meta: I have a couple of days off in Leeds around two conferences; let’s meet…?
---

It seems that tech events in [Leeds](http://bit.ly/14Id5QD)—where I live—are
like buses; you wait ages for one and then two show up at once! These are:

* [Hey!Stac](http://hey.wearestac.com/)
* [Speak the Web](https://tito.io/speaktheweb/leeds).

Both are to be held on **23 July, 2013**, which means people can only make one
or the other. I will be attending Hey!Stac as it’s run by a good friend of mine,
[Josh Nesbitt](https://twitter.com/joshnesbitt), and I was down to attend that
one first. This means that there will be a whole host of people at Speak the Web
the _very same_ evening that I won’t get to meet up with, and I love meeting up
with people.

As such, I’ve booked the whole of the 23rd and 24th off work in order to have a
couple of free days hanging out in Leeds. I have
[Chad Tomkiss](https://twitter.com/chadtomkiss)—who is speaking at
Hey!Stac—staying with me a couple of nights, and in the days we are free just to
hang out in Leeds doing whatever. So…

1. If you’re attending either event and are about _and_ fancy meeting up at any
   point during either day for beer/coffee/food/whatever then just let me know.
   I’ve made sure I’ll be about all day both days in the hope of getting to meet
   some new folk.
2. After both events are done, groups from each could congregate in town and hit
   some nice bars.

I know all the decent places, just [ask
Ashley](http://girlwithacamera.co.uk/leeds/)!

So yeah, long shot, but if anyone is about and fancies meeting up either during
the day(s) or after the events, lemme know!
