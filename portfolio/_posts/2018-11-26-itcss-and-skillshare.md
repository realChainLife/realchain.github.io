Back in February 2018, Scott Sullivan, Partnerships Team Lead at
[Skillshare](https://skl.sh/harry), sent me an email asking if I’d be
interested in collaborating on an official ITCSS video course in conjunction
with them.

The email was extremely well timed. ITCSS is a mature and very successful piece
of work of which I am very proud, but with my recent move to focussing more on
front-end performance, I was keen to set ITCSS a little more free: I wanted to
liberate the content and make it more widely and cheaply available.

I’d always been pretty closed-source with ITCSS as it was a large part of my
billable client work. This is exactly why documentation around ITCSS is so hard
to find—there’s [an empty website](https://itcss.io/) and a handful of
(remarkably thorough!) blog posts out there with which developers can piece
together the concepts themselves, but ITCSS had always been reserved for clients
and workshop attendees.

Now felt like the right time to set ITCSS free, and Skillshare felt like the
right people to do it with: from the way Scott conducted himself from the very
start, to the incredibly creator-friendly terms of their contract, to the way
Alex ran filming on the day, I felt like this was the best partnership ITCSS and
I could have.

Together, we produced a 40-minute class that introduces the problems of CSS at
scale, and how ITCSS begins to formally solve them. Using [my referral
link](https://skl.sh/harry), you can get access to two months of Premium
Skillshare: [skl.sh/harry](https://skl.sh/harry)

For more advanced ITCSS implementation, you can always [hire me](/contact/), or
if there’s enough interest in an _Advanced ITCSS_ class, [let us
know…](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40csswizardry%20%40skillshare%20I%20would%20be%20really%20interested%20in%20an%20Advanced%20ITCSS%20class%21)
