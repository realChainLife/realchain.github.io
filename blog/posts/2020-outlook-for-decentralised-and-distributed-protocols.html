                                <p>As an emerging technology, decentralized & distributed protocols have enjoyed tremendous scientific 
                                    growth and development this year. We've seen an increase in utilization of cryptography in distributed 
                                    systems for the creation of new or improvement of existing blockchain architectures. We've also seen 
                                    remarkable improvement in the analysis of cryptoeconomic factors like tracking resource usage, costing 
                                    techniques and more. 
                                </p>
                                <p>While 2019 has been an interesting year for the cryptocurrency markets, this post will be covering certain 
                                    engineering and scientific prospects of decentralized and distributed protocols without a deep-dive into 
                                    a price analysis outlook or other investor related topics.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Cryptography Outlook</h2>
                                <p>Cryptography today seemingly lies at the center of many projects working with distributed systems and protocols, 
                                    but to truly appreciate the evolution that has brought cryptography to the forefront as prime technology, we 
                                    must first appreciate all its uses in decentralized architectures today. Several blockchain networks use 
                                    cryptographic tools to run functions like encryption, digital signatures and hashing. 
                                </p>
                                <p>With other technologies, cryptography is deployed to secure web browsing, run end-to-end encrypted messaging, 
                                    document signing and even disk encryption. No where however, has the use of cryptography stood out like its 
                                    use on the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/"><b>Bitcoin Network</b></a>. For 10 years, Bitcoin's network 
                                    has been running several cryptographic algorithms that underlie its <i>mining functions</i>, <i>digital 
                                    signing</i> and <i>key/wallet management</i> functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>Since coming to the mainstream, Bitcoin has made cryptography and its use in decentralized and distributed networks 
                                    an emerging technology whose utilization is increasing around the world:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Countries like China, <a href="https://chainbulletin.com/china-passes-cryptography-law-into-effect-in-2020/"><b>who 
                                        recently passed a cryptography law</b></a>, are taking steps to create a regulatory framework that will set the 
                                        standards for the application of cryptographic solutions. This framework is inteneded to guide the independent 
                                        innovation of core technologies, increase investment and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial 
                                        innovation in the country.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>With companies we've seen an increase in releases of cryptography solutions. IBM, earlier this year, released the 
                                        prototype to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/08/crystals/"><b>worldâ€™s first quantum computing 
                                        safe enterprise class tape</b></a>. The solution is expected to secure data protected by asymetric encrytion methods 
                                        which may not be secure in the next 10-30 years. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Propects for the unlocking of new computational capabilities in the computing industry have been increased further by an 
                                    announcement from Google suggesting <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/google-claims-quantum-supremacy/"><b>researchers 
                                    demonstrated quantum Supremacy</b></a> in recent experiments. Businesses and organizations today should start preparing for 
                                    advancements that will see cryptography deployed to power unprecedented sceientic breakthroughs. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Secure Scaling Outlook</h2>
                                <p>Discussions around scaling decentralized and distributed networks are often associated with the difficulty of the technical 
                                    consensus-building process, evalution of technical materials and data analysis to fully consider the complex tradeoff between 
                                    decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. Through the year Bitcoin, Ethereum and IPFS communities have 
                                    had conversations about secure on-chain scaling on their respective networks.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>At the <a href="https://telaviv2019.scalingbitcoin.org/"><b>Scaling Bitcoin</b></a> conference in Tel Aviv 
                                        in September, discussions about scaling Bitcoin happened through presentations and workshops. The Lightning 
                                        based presentations highlighted methods the <a href="https://lightningntwork.com">Lightning Network</a> can 
                                        be optimized for example, <i>Improving routing with Trampoline Payments</i>, <i>Output: The responsive lightweight 
                                        watchtower</i> and <i>Acai, a backup protocol for Lightning network wallets.</i>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>For Web3.0 solutions to develop and compete with Web2.0 platforms, a decentralised base layer is what they need
                                        and get from IPFS. With its highly connected node structure, IPFS is great at retrieving and serving data. To 
                                        leverage these two properties to build decentralized applications the network needs to maintain high speed, 
                                        node availability and a great user experience. Solutions like <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/ipfs-scalability-f0a6f8a7d42b"><b>Pinata's Layer 2</b></a> 
                                        have been developed to provide faster data retrieval services through a pre-existing base layer of nodes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>One of the more frequent targets for the scalability debate however, is Ethereum. Its block propagation standard 
                                        has been criticised for being slow yet it remains expensive to transact on, with gas prices up to around 20 cents. 
                                        In the major network upgrade, <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/"><b>Ethereum 2.0</b></a>, 
                                        developers are designing a solution that's focused on decentralization and security with layer 2 solutions 
                                        including sharding, plasma and channels.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Combined with <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/data-compression-for-large-scale-streaming-experimentation-c20bfab8b9ce"><b>data compression</b></a>

                                <h2>Attack Analysis and Threat Modeling Outlook</h2>
                                <p>Several blockchain networks, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have largely managed to avoid catastrophic 
                                    cyber security issues largely due to a robust core architecture that has the potential to be safe aganist 
                                    quantum attacks on their networks core functions. The cryposystems used to create this sturdiness is a 
                                    combination of hashing algorithms, the number of nodes in operation, and the clear mining and block validation 
                                    processes.
                                </p>
                                <p>Immutability is another cryptosystem usually referenced to describe irreversibility of transactions. Data 
                                    permanence and auditability are critical components of the design for public-permissionless distributed networks. 
                                    As the nature of network attacks has evolved over the years, the concept of immutability within distributed 
                                    technology has been revealed to be a potentially costly oversimplification. Beyond consensus attacks, the 
                                    feasibility of atttacks on side channel implementations of a network have also been demonstrated.
                                </p>
                                <p>To design security models for the quantum era, network maintainers need to, through probabilistic analysis, 
                                    quantify the resources involved in initiating an attack using simulations, measurements and experiments with 
                                    live nodes. This will present countermeasures that are designed to raise the bar for attacks while preserving 
                                    the openness and decentralization of the network's architecture.  
                                </p>
                                <h2>Cryptoeconomics Outlook</h2>
                                <p>Economists studying protocols, with a focus on design and characterization of permissionless networks, have 
                                    found various economic aspects including; <i>protocol-native aspects</i>, <i>third party market aspects</i>, 
                                    <i>mining economics</i>, <i>transaction fee market</i>, <i>gas prices</i> and more, all play an integral role 
                                    in how distributed and decentralized networks are able to function.
                                </p>
                                <p>With mining economics for instance, Bitcoin introduced block rewards which work to incentivize users to willingly 
                                    contribute to the network's benefit. In May 2020, we expect a bitcoin halving and in a <a href="https://realchainlife.github.io/blog/posts/bitcoin-halving-everything-you-need-to-know.html">
                                    <b>post</b></a> earlier this year, I wrote about everything you need to know on the subject. It ll be interesting 
                                    to see how the impending halving will impact the network's economic factors like transacftion fees, mining 
                                    costs and unit prices.
                                </p>
                                <p>Although decentralized file sharing systems have existed for nearly 20 years, its modern blockchain networks
                                    that have introduced economic features to correct the incentive shortfall. Various networks have deployed
                                    creative solutions to high transaction fees including solutions like sub-second finality and more efficient 
                                    consensus algorithms. We should expect more development of this space.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>There are other aspects of distributed protocols that influence its usability, functionality and efficiency. Although, 
                                    most are still in development, they add unique value to a network. These include:
