                                <p>As an emerging technology, decentralized & distributed protocols have enjoyed tremendous scientific 
                                    growth and development this year. We've seen an increase in utilization of cryptography in distributed 
                                    systems for the creation of new or improvement of existing blockchain architectures. We've also seen 
                                    remarkable improvement in the analysis of cryptoeconomic factors like tracking resource usage, costing 
                                    techniques and more. 
                                </p>
                                <p>While 2019 has been an interesting year for the cryptocurrency markets, this post will be covering certain 
                                    engineering and scientific prospects of decentralized and distributed protocols without a deep-dive into 
                                    a price analysis outlook or other investor related topics.

                                <h3>Cryptography Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Cryptography today seemingly lies at the center of many projects working with distributed systems and protocols, 
                                    but to truly appreciate the evolution that has brought cryptography to the forefront as prime technology, we 
                                    must first appreciate all its uses in decentralized architectures today. Several blockchain networks use 
                                    cryptographic tools to run functions like encryption, digital signatures and hashing. 
                                </p>
                                <p>With other technologies, cryptography is deployed to secure web browsing, run end-to-end encrypted messaging, 
                                    document signing and even disk encryption. No where however, has the use of cryptography stood out like its 
                                    use on the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/"><b>Bitcoin Network</b></a>. For 10 years, Bitcoin's network 
                                    has been running several cryptographic algorithms that underlie its <i>mining functions</i>, <i>digital 
                                    signing</i> and <i>key/wallet management</i> functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>Since coming to the mainstream, Bitcoin has made cryptography and its use in decentralized and distributed networks 
                                    an emerging technology whose utilization is increasing around the world:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Countries like China, <a href="https://chainbulletin.com/china-passes-cryptography-law-into-effect-in-2020/"><b>who 
                                        recently passed a cryptography law</b></a>, are taking steps to create a regulatory framework that will set the 
                                        standards for the application of cryptographic solutions. This framework is inteneded to guide the independent 
                                        innovation of core technologies, increase investment and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial 
                                        innovation in the country.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>With companies we've seen an increase in releases of cryptography solutions. IBM, earlier this year, released the 
                                        prototype to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/08/crystals/"><b>worldâ€™s first quantum computing 
                                        safe enterprise class tape</b></a>. The solution is expected to secure data protected by asymetric encrytion methods 
                                        which may not be secure in the next 10-30 years. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Propects for the unlocking of new computational capabilities in the computing industry have been increased further by an 
                                    announcement from Google suggesting <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/google-claims-quantum-supremacy/"><b>researchers 
                                    demonstrated quantum Supremacy</b></a> in recent experiments. Businesses and organizations today should start preparing for 
                                    advancements that will see cryptography deployed to power unprecedented sceientic breakthroughs. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Secure Scaling Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Discussions around scaling decentralized and distributed networks are often associated with the difficulty of the technical 
                                    consensus-building process, evalution of technical materials and data analysis to fully consider the complex tradeoff between 
                                    decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. Through the year Bitcoin, Ethereum and IPFS communities have 
                                    had conversations about secure on-chain scaling on their respective networks.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>At the <a href="https://telaviv2019.scalingbitcoin.org/"><b>Scaling Bitcoin</b></a> conference in Tel Aviv 
                                        in September, discussions about scaling Bitcoin happened through presentations and workshops. The Lightning 
                                        based presentations highlighted methods the <a href="https://lightningntwork.com">Lightning Network</a> can 
                                        be optimized for example, <i>Improving routing with Trampoline Payments</i>, <i>Output: The responsive lightweight 
                                        watchtower</i> and <i>Acai, a backup protocol for Lightning network wallets.</i>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>For Web3.0 solutions to develop and compete with Web2.0 platforms, a decentralised base layer is what they need
                                        and get from IPFS. With its highly connected node structure, IPFS is great at retrieving and serving data. To 
                                        leverage these two properties to build decentralized applications the network needs to maintain high speed, 
                                        node availability and a great user experience. Solutions like <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/ipfs-scalability-f0a6f8a7d42b"><b>Pinata's Layer 2</b></a> 
                                        have been developed to provide faster data retrieval services through a pre-existing base layer of nodes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>One of the more frequent targets for the scalability debate however, is Ethereum. Its block propagation standard 
                                        has been criticised for being slow yet it remains expensive to transact on, with gas prices up to around 20 cents. 
                                        In the major network upgrade, <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/"><b>Ethereum 2.0</b></a>, 
                                        developers are designing a solution that's focused on decentralization and security with layer 2 solutions 
                                        including sharding, plasma and channels.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Attack Analysis and Threat Modeling Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Several blockchain networks, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have largely managed to avoid catastrophic 
                                    cyber security issues largely due to a robust core architecture that has the potential to be safe aganist 
                                    quantum attacks on their networks core functions. The cryposystems used to create this sturdiness is a 
                                    combination of hashing algorithms (SHA-256 for Bitcoin and KECCAK-256 for Ethereum), the number of nodes in 
                                    operation, and the clear mining and block validation processes.
                                </p>
                                <p>Immutability is another cryptosystem that often means different things to different people, its usually 
                                    referenced to describe irreversibility of transactions. Regardless of the unique features available in different 
                                    blockchain networks, data permanence and auditability remain critical parts of the design for public-permission 
                                    less distributed networks. As the nature of network attacks has evolved over the years, the concept of 
                                    immutability within distributed technology has been revealed to be a potentially costly oversimplification.
                                </p>
                                <p>Beyond consensus attacks, distributed systems are also prone to attacks on side channel implementations of a 
                                    network. Researchers discovered that the Lightning Network is vulnerable to DoS attacks. In a paper by Saar 
                                    Tochner, Aviv Zohar (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Stefan Schmid (University of Vienna) - they <i>identified 
                                    a novel attack on off-chain networks which introduces an interesting tradeoff both for an attacker as well 
                                    as the rational defender.</i> They demonstrated the feasibility of this attack on different networks.
                                </p>
                                <p>To design security models for the quantum era, network maintainers need to look beyond cryptographic, consensus 
                                    and hardware attacks on cryptosystems. Through probabilistic analysis and cryptanalysis of quantum systems, 
                                    they need to quantify the resources involved in an attack using simulations, measurements and experiments with 
                                    live nodes. This will present countermeasures that are designed to raise the bar for attacks while preserving 
                                    the openness and decentralization of the network's architecture.  
                                </p>
                                <h3>Cryptoeconomics Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Economists working with permissionless networks have been studying these protocols, focusing on the design and 
                                    characterization have found various economic aspects including; <i>protocol-native aspects</i>, <i>third party 
                                    market aspects</i>, <i>mining economics</i>, <i>transaction fee market</i>, <i>gas prices</i> and more; all play 
                                    an integral role in how distributed and decentralized networks are able to function.
                                </p>
                                <p>With mining economics for instance, expect most discussion around Bitcoin to be monoplozed by the upcoming Bitcoin 
                                    MIning reward halving happening in May 2020. In a post earlier this year, I wrote about the bitcoin halvening and 
                                    everything you need to know. An additional outlook to complement the sentiment in my previous post is this, File-sharing systems like Bittorrent launched 
                                    almost two decades ago. The reason why they havenâ€™t gained wild success is because they have no functionality 
                                    that compels their users to willingly contribute to the networkâ€™s benefit. Block rewards was a way for blockchain systems 
                                    to correct the incentive fall-short. It'll be interesting to see how the impending halving will impact the network.

                                <p>Away from cryptocurrency networks, there are other aspects of distributed protocols that influence its usability, functionality 
                                    and efficiency. On the IPFS netowrk for example, cryptographic hash functions are used to identify nodes and issue a 
                                    NodeId which are incentived to remain the same. Their public keys can be used to encrypt data before it is transferred, preventing interception and theft.
                                    Ensuring Solutions to the security issues of todayâ€™s web are built into this addressing system.

                                <p>Bitcoinâ€™s mining rewards halving, which is expected to occur in May 2020, has long monopolized discussions about 
                                    the digital assetâ€™s valuation and the profitability of cryptocurrency mining.
