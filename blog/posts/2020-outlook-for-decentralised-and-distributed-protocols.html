                                <p>As an emerging technology, decentralized & distributed protocols have enjoyed tremendous scientific 
                                    growth and development this year. We've seen an increase in utilization of cryptography in distributed 
                                    systems for the creation of new or improvement of existing blockchain architectures. We've also seen 
                                    remarkable improvement in the analysis of cryptoeconomic factors like tracking resource usage, costing 
                                    techniques and more. 
                                </p>
                                <p>While 2019 has been an interesting year for the cryptocurrency markets, this post will be covering certain 
                                    engineering and scientific prospects of decentralized and distributed protocols without a deep-dive into 
                                    a price analysis outlook or other investor related topics. Some of the engineering and scientific prospects 
                                    we'll cover include:
                                </p>
                                <ul type="square">
                                    <li>Attacks and Threats Outlook</li>
                                    <li>Cryptoeconomics Outlook</li>
                                    <li>Third Party Ecosystem</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Cryptography Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Cryptography today seemingly lies at the center of many projects working with distributed systems and protocols, 
                                    but to truly appreciate the evolution that has brought cryptography to the forefront as prime technology, we 
                                    must first appreciate all its uses in decentralized architectures today. Several blockchain networks use 
                                    cryptographic tools to run functions like encryption, digital signatures and hashing. 
                                </p>
                                <p>With other technologies, cryptography is deployed to secure web browsing, run end-to-end encrypted messaging, 
                                    document signing and even disk encryption. No where however, has the use of cryptography stood out like its 
                                    use on the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/"><b>Bitcoin Network</b></a>. For 10 years, Bitcoin's network 
                                    has been running several cryptographic algorithms that underlie its <i>mining functions</i>, <i>digital 
                                    signing</i> and <i>key/wallet management</i> functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>Since coming to the mainstream, Bitcoin has made cryptography and its use in decentralized and distributed networks 
                                    an emerging technology whose utilization is increasing around the world:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Countries like China, <a href="https://chainbulletin.com/china-passes-cryptography-law-into-effect-in-2020/"><b>who 
                                        recently passed a cryptography law</b></a>, are taking steps to create a regulatory framework that will set the 
                                        standards for the application of cryptographic solutions. This framework is inteneded to guide the independent 
                                        innovation of core technologies, increase investment and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial 
                                        innovation in the country.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>With companies we've seen an increase in releases of cryptography solutions. IBM, earlier this year, released the 
                                        prototype to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/08/crystals/"><b>worldâ€™s first quantum computing 
                                        safe enterprise class tape</b></a>. The solution is expected to secure data protected by asymetric encrytion methods 
                                        which may not be secure in the next 10-30 years. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Propects for the unlocking of new computational capabilities in the computing industry have been increased further by an 
                                    announcement from Google suggesting <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/google-claims-quantum-supremacy/"><b>researchers 
                                    demonstrated quantum Supremacy</b></a> in recent experiments. Businesses and organizations today should start preparing for 
                                    advancements that will see cryptography deployed to power unprecedented sceientic breakthroughs. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Secure Scaling Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Discussions around scaling decentralized and distributed networks are often associated with the difficulty of the technical 
                                    consensus-building process, evalution of technical materials and data analysis to fully consider the complex tradeoff between 
                                    decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. Through the year Bitcoin, Ethereum and IPFS communities have 
                                    had conversations about secure on-chain scaling on their respective networks.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>At the <a href="https://telaviv2019.scalingbitcoin.org/"><b>Scaling Bitcoin</b></a> conference in Tel Aviv 
                                        in September, discussions about scaling Bitcoin happened through presentations and workshops. The Lightning 
                                        based presentations highlighted methods the <a href="https://lightningntwork.com">Lightning Network</a> can 
                                        be optimized for example, <i>Improving routing with Trampoline Payments</i>, <i>Output: The responsive lightweight 
                                        watchtower</i> and <i>Acai, a backup protocol for Lightning network wallets.</i>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>For Web3.0 solutions to develop and compete with Web2.0 platforms, a decentralised base layer is what they need
                                        and get from IPFS. With its highly connected node structure, IPFS is great at retrieving and serving data. To 
                                        leverage these two properties to build decentralized applications the network needs to maintain high speed, 
                                        node availability and a great user experience. Solutions like <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/ipfs-scalability-f0a6f8a7d42b"><b>Pinata's Layer 2</b></a> 
                                        have been developed to provide faster data retrieval services through a pre-existing base layer of nodes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>One of the more frequent targets for the scalability debate however, is Ethereum. Its block propagation standard 
                                        has been criticised for being slow yet it remains expensive to transact on, with gas prices up to around 20 cents. 
                                        In the major network upgrade, <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/"><b>Ethereum 2.0</b></a>, 
                                        developers are designing a solution that's focused on decentralization and security with layer 2 solutions 
                                        including sharding, plasma and channels.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Combined with <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/data-compression-for-large-scale-streaming-experimentation-c20bfab8b9ce%22%3E"><b>data compression</b></a>

                                <h3>Attack Analysis and Threat Modeling Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Many public blockchains, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have largely managed to avoid catastrophic cyber 
                                    security issues related to their core function because their core architecture is robust. Cryptosystems that 
                                    have the potential to be safe against quantum computers such as: code-based, hash-based, isogeny-based, lattice
                                    -based, and multivariate constructions. An element of this sturdiness comes from several sources, including 
                                    their well-understood and simple hashing algorithms (SHA-256 for Bitcoin and KECCAK-256 for Ethereum), the number
                                     of nodes in operation, and the straightforward method by which mining and validation is accomplished.
                                </p>
                                <p>Immutability often means different things to different people, and not all blockchains are created equal 
                                    when it comes to the irreversibility of transactions. Regardless of the unique features available in different 
                                    blockchain networks, data permanence and auditability remain critical parts of the design for public-permission 
                                    less distributed networks. As the nature of network attacks has evolved over the years, the concept of 
                                    immutability within blockchain technology has been revealed to be a potentially costly oversimplification.
                                </p>
                                <p>If determined foes can alter a blockchain, even temporarily, then many blockchain systems may be more fragile 
                                    than is commonly perceived. These attacks show that protecting the permanence of data on the blockchain cannot 
                                    be assumed, but instead is an evolving challenge and an important consideration for those who design, manage, 
                                    participate in and rely upon blockchain networks for their businesses.
                                </p>
                                <p>Beyond consenus attacks, distributed systems are also prone to attacks on side channel implementations of a 
                                    network. Researchers discovered that the Lightning Network is vulnerable to DoS attacks. In a paper by Saar 
                                    Tochner, 
                                    Aviv Zohar (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Stefan Schmid (University of Vienna) - they <i>identified a 
                                    novel attack on off-chain networks which introduces an interesting tradeoff both for an attacker as well as 
                                    the rational defender.</i> They demonstrated the feasibility of this attack on different networks and provided 
                                    the first analysis.
                                </p>
                                <p>Cryptographic, consensus and hardware attacks have been part and parcel of distributed systems. Despite the 
                                    infrequent number of reports regarding network attacks this year, the risk of these attacks is a concern 
                                    network architects and system designers or maintainers monitor consistently.
                                </p>
                                <p>eclipse attacks on bitcoinâ€™s Lightning network  allows an adversary controlling a sufficient number of IP 
                                    addresses to monopolize all connections to and from a victim bitcoin node. The attacker can then exploit the 
                                    victim for attacks on bitcoinâ€™s mining and consensus system, including N-confirmation double spending, selfish 
                                    mining, and adversarial forks in the blockchain. 
                                </p>
                                <p>We take a detailed look at bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and quantify the resources involved in our attack via 
                                    probabilistic analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, measurements and experiments with live bitcoin nodes. Finally, 
                                    we present countermeasures, inspired by botnet architectures, that are designed to raise the bar for eclipse 
                                    attacks while preserving the openness and decentralization of bitcoinâ€™s current network architecture.

                                <p>Collectivized mining operations (i.e., mining pools) that pool hashrate for larger and more predictable payouts 
                                    have existed since the early days of Bitcoin. These operations provide a user-friendly way for ordinary people 
                                    to contribute (or purchase) hashrate and collaboratively mine without the difficulties associated with setting 
                                    up and maintaining their own node on a blockchain network.

                                <p>Cryptoeconomics as a topic is built on multiple subtopics. These include an analysis of on-chain resources costs 
                                    like mining economics, the transaction fee market, disk/memory uses and costs. Other aspects of cryptoeconomics 
                                    is a review of the techniques for measurement of resource use and cost, decentralized money supply algorithms and 
                                    decentralized stabilization algorithms.
