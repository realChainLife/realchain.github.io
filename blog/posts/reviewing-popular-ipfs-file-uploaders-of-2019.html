                                <p>Decentralized applications (or Dapps) are server-less applications that run 
                                    on a P2P network of computers rather than a single computer. They can be run 
                                    jointly on the client side and within a blockchain based distributed network - 
                                    although they don’t necessarily need to run on top of a blockchain network.
                                </p>
                                <p>BitTorrent, Popcorn Time, BitMessage, Tor, are all traditional dApps that run 
                                    on a P2P network, but not on a Blockchain (<strong>which is a specific kind of P2P network</strong>).

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Features of a blockchain dApp;</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Technically most of the Decentralised applications run on the principle of 
                                    `smart contracts` with no centralized authority controlling the application. 
                                    The apps contain real-world assets which can be used within the network. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Features of a Decentralized Application</h2>
                                <p>If you're going to build a dApp, there are some prominent features that I suggest 
                                    be included by default. These features prove that programmable trust could power 
                                    a `decentralized system` without the need for a central institution. These are the 
                                    technological features that will power modern applications of all kinds:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Censorship Resistance Apps</strong> - As the number of countries engaged 
                                      in some form of censorship continues to increase YOY it will be important that you 
                                      create applications on a decentralized infrastructure with a natural resistance to 
                                      all forms of censorship.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Resilience & Reliability</strong> - The dApp logic and data should be 
                                      replicated across all the participating nodes on the networks using smart contracts. 
                                      These replicated and distributed smart contracts will ensure fulltime availability 
                                      and reliability for the dApp.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Auditability & transparency</strong> - With the integrated smart contracts, 
                                      users can verify the code implementing the business logic. This provides additional 
                                      transparency and verifiable trust model to dApps.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Better Business Model</strong> - For Web decentralization to work, we need 
                                      to develop commercialization models that are not only user friendly but also provided 
                                      better mechanism designs and digital assets - these will cultivate a better internet.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Cryptographic Key Management</strong> - Because the production of digital 
                                      assets go hand-in-hand with protection, dApps need to incorporate asymmetric encryption 
                                      systems for the user credential management policy. This creates a very sparse and 
                                      challenging attack surface. A hacker now has to breach each user individually.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Using Dapps, we can design platforms that are fully decentralized and give more control 
                                    to users. There are very few mobile app developers out there who understand the nitty 
                                    gritty of developing a decentralized app. Though blockchain enthusiasts have definitely 
                                    increased over the past few years, there is still a deficiency of expert decentralized 
                                    app developers.
                                </p>
                                <p>Regardless of where you fall on the developer skill level, anyone can try out a few 
                                    methods to developing dApps that can be compiled into an easy-to-follow guide.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Developing Decentralized Apps</h2>
                                <p>Before we get started with key steps involved in the developing, building and 
                                    deploying of decentralized applications its important to remind ourselves that 
                                    this field is constantly evolving and that it is always a good idea to keep 
                                    refreshing your knowledge on the subject.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Development Step I: Defining Your Environment</h3>
                                <p>Deciding which blockchain environment would best fit a business creates a headache 
                                    formany companies and developers. Due to the fragmented nature of the industry, 
                                    technology implemented by some companies faces many risks including <em>obsoletion, insecurity, cost-inefficieny</em> 
                                    and so on.
                                </p>
                                <p>To avoid the pains associated with poor matching of a solution to technology, 
                                    developers need to determine the type of technology required for each area of 
                                    development i.e.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Database Management</li>
                                    <li>APIs</li>
                                    <li>Development Servers</li>
                                    <li>Hosting</li>
                                    <li>Frameworks</li>
                                    <li>Programming Language</li>
                                    <li>& Frontend</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Each technology choice contributes to the final efficiency, usability and 
                                    commercialibilty of the dApp and thus its can be called a critical factor of 
                                    dApp development.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Development Step II: Set Up Development Framework</h3>
                                <p>Dependent on the technology you've chosen to work with, we will proceed to 
                                    installing the development framework, dependancies and evironment needed to 
                                    start working on the codebase and business logic for the smart contracts.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are two development frameworks that are most common and available for 
                                    developers to select from:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Platform Apps</strong> - These are suitable for developers 
                                      new to decentralized app building. Platforms like Hyperledger, Ethereum 
                                      or Azure provide easy to follow steps to deploying application most 
                                      of them requiring developers to only write a smart contract that is 
                                      deployed on the network through a series of automatic functions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Software Apps</strong> - With this approach, developers can 
                                      leverage pre-exiting softwares to build new sofwares or dApps that provide 
                                      a specific suitable solution to existing network problems. AN example 
                                      is the Lightning Network build on Bitcoin to solve the problem of 
                                      high-cost transactions.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Based on the framework of choice, you'll need to set up all the tools you will 
                                    need for the end-to-end development and deployment of the app. Every framework 
                                    provides an easy to work with development platform including Truffle on Ethereum. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Development Step III: Code The Application</h3>
                                <p>The core of any decentralized application is the business logic written into
                                    its smart contract. Though it might feel a little counterproductive for a new
                                    learning curve to be indroduced to something as basic as a programming language,
                                    that's excatly what happens with some blockchain networks.
                                </p>
                                <p>As a developer of a dApp, you'll need to learn & adopt to each development platform's
                                    <em>standard</em> for writing smart contracts. On <strong>Ethereum</strong> for example, 
                                    smart contracts are written in specific new language,

                                    a special editor <strong>Remix</strong>. On <strong>Hyperledger</strong> smart contracts 
                                    are referred to as <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4ade.html">Chaincode</a> 
                                    development, creation and deployment of applications on Hyperledger Fabric.
                                </p>
                                <p>In this example, we have two solutions that have addressed the issue of programming
                                    language differently. Chaincode is implementable in <em>Go, node.js or java</em> - 
                                    already common languages but Ethereum requires you to learn the the language
                                    from scratch. This should be considered in while choosing the preferred development
                                    environment. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Here, you should also consider your <em>Frontend UI</em> options and include the design 
                                    and development process in the entire coding phase. This will be important for the dApp 
                                    tests that will be done in the next step.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Development Step IV: Deploy & Test Application</h3>
                                <p>Before we can launch and start using our application in the last step we need to 
                                    deploy and test what you've developed. For majority of platform applications this
                                    step is as simple as:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Uploading the configuration files and smart contracts</li>
                                    <li>Adding network participants</li>
                                    <li>Running test transactions</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>It is worth noting that any deployed smart contract code will be unalterable and 
                                    forever stored on the blockchain. For this reason, you should know before beginning
                                    all the <em>variables</em> that will be testnet for various function performance tracking.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Development Step V: Launch The App</h3>
                                <p>This can be the most exciting and daunting phase of the entire development process.
                                    Exciting because the fruit of your hardwork is seemingly ready to be shared with 
                                    the world - daunting because any mistakes in the development of the application
                                    can lead to un-usability of the dApp.
                                </p>
                                <p>Once your app has been tested you will be ready to launch it. Choose a custom domain 
                                    for the application and let everyone know it is up and ready. Keep in mind that this 
                                    will be the most intensive part of your marketing strategy and you should keep up the 
                                    same level of hard work and diligence that lead to you creating a great app in the 
                                    first place.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Decentralized Apps of The Future</h2>
                                <p>Time and time again I have mentioned the importance of the <em>Decentralized Web</em>
                                    and the role decentralized applications will play in the mainstream adoption
                                    of decentralized and distributed systems.
                                </p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>A major challenge we face with the current client/server models we use on our
                                    applications gives hackers a single point at which to orchestrate attacks. This 
                                    failure has resulted in massive data breaches which have not only cost huge sums 
                                    of money, but have also dented customer trust as well. Decentralization prevents 
                                    these kinds of attacks because there is no one point of failure.
                                </p>
                                <p>The decentralized application will be held to the same criteria of decentralized
                                     applications in development today:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>Distributed Ledger</strong> - Application’s data and records of 
                                      operation must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized 
                                      blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Generate Tokens</strong> - Application must generate tokens according 
                                      to a standard cryptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value, for example 
                                      Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work Algorithm to generate more BTC.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - Application must operate autonomously, and 
                                      with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens - the consensus of its 
                                      users must decide all changes.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>dAapps act as an enabler for new kinds of applications providing decentralized 
                                    scalability, strong security, resilience, and availability. By building on the 
                                    current technical solutions we will offer significant control to end-users on 
                                    their credentials, data, and communications and hence will create a major shift, 
                                    particularly in consumer applications.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Overview: Decentralized Application Platforms</h2>
                                <p>As I've mentioned sparsely in the steps to developing, deploying and launching
                                    a decentralized applications, <i>platform apps</i> offer various easy solutions to 
                                    dApp development.
                                </p>
                                  <p>In this last segment I want to hightlight, briefly, some of my favorite platforms
                                    to work with for smart contract deployment: 
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong><a href="https://blockstream.com/liquid/">Liquid Network</a></strong> - 
                                      This Bitcoin sidechain was announced by Blockstream in 2016 and is set for 
                                      release later this year, will provide participants various benefits including 
                                      <strong>rapid transfers, issued assets & streamlined development</strong>.</li>
                                    <li><strong><a href="https:ethereum.org">Ethereum</a></strong> - Perhaps the most 
                                      popular dApp platform, Ethereum provides users with multiple tools like Truffle, 
                                      Web3, Remix and more to facilitate the creation and deployment of smart contracts. 
                                      Learning <strong>Solidity</strong> is easy as well which is a very welcome addition to the 
                                      ease-of-use of Ethereum.
                                    </li>

                                <p>This list although not exhaustive covers the platform that are currently
                                    developing solutions that I think will contribute greatly to how we 
                                    write and deploy decentralized applications:
