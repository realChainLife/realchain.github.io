It looks as though your device is offline. Not to worry; I’ve prepared some
offline content for you to read whilst you wait for your connection to come
back:

* [head to the homepage](/);
* [learn about the services I offer](/blog/services/); or;
* [find out how best to get in touch with me](/contact/).

Or if you’d like to read something:

* [Why We Must Decentralize The Web](/blog/2019/03/why-we-must-distribute-the-web/)
* [Let's Decentralize The Web](/blog/2018/06/lets-decentralize-the-web/)
* [Content Addressing: What Makes The IPFS Revolutionary](2018/08/content-addressing-what-makes-the-ipfs-revolutionary/)
* [Building Decentralized Applications](/2018/04/building-decentralized-applications/)

I’m next appearing at:

<ul>

  {% include speaking.html %}

</ul>
