Offering continuous edcuation opportunities is slowly becoming a large part of 
work. I do this by hosting individuals, groups or clients at workshops and training 
events. From the smallest of independent companies, to
organisations with over 300,000 employees, I have taught hundreds of people how
to write better, more scalable, more maintainable CSS, and how to make
substantial savings on their load times.

I aim to customise in-house training and workshops to ensure that your team get
the most relevant and pertinent information possible, so before we work together
I will ask a series of questions (either via email or on a call) to see where
you‚Äôre currently at, where you need to be, and what you want to know. My main
areas of expertise are front-end performance and CSS architecture, and clients
often opt to run a hybrid of the two. It‚Äôs entirely up to you.

With a truly international reputation, my workshops have been delivered from New
Zealand to Romania, Uruguay to the US: you‚Äôre in good hands.

## Decentralized Protocol Systems

My front-end performance knowledge is incredibly extensive. I‚Äôve helped
billion-dollar companies to make tangible performance improvements that have
made notable impact on their bottom line. During our time together, your team
will learn:

* the moral and business impact of good performance;
* how the network really works, and how to play to its strengths and weaknesses;
* how to optimise our assets for most effective delivery;
* how to trick the browser into downloading things ahead of time;
* how to detect and troubleshoot performance issues;
* how to measure performance successes;
* how to prepare for the performance landscape of tomorrow;
* and much, much more.

The amount of content in this workshop cannot be overstated, so expect intense
and very full days.

  <p>We hired Harry to provide performance consultancy on a high
  profile and highly trafficked website for one of Europe‚Äôs most recognised
  authorities. His detailed and intricate knowledge of how the network and the
  browser work allowed him to improve performance by over 400%, all without
  sacrificing or removing any assets or features from any of the website. By
  analysing how the site was put together, and how browsers were dealing with
  it, he managed to optimise and restructure things in such a way that load
  times went from around 6.25 seconds to just 1.5.</p>

My performance work has been implemented on very highly trafficked and
high-availability websites, making dramatic improvements to page speed without
sacrificing the quality or integrity of any of the website‚Äôs content or assets.
