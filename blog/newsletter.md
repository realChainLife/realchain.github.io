I maintain a small and infrequent newsletter in order to share more detailed and
exclusive content with those who want it the most.

<ul class="c-nav-secondary" id="section:subscribers">
  <li class="c-nav-secondary__item"><a href="#section:subscribers" class="c-nav-secondary__link  is-current">For Subscribers</a></li>
  <li class="c-nav-secondary__item"><a href="#section:sponsors" class="c-nav-secondary__link">For Sponsors</a></li>
</ul>

The format of the newsletter will evolve over time, but for now you should
expect:

* Exclusive content, screencasts, demos.
* Members-only discounts for upcoming events and workshops.
* Links to interesting articles and resources from around the web.

And you should not expect:

* Spam. Honestly, it‚Äôs the worst.
* Updates for the sake of updates. I will only publish when there‚Äôs something
  worth sharing.

Not that fussed about email? You can still catch me [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realchainlife) instead.
