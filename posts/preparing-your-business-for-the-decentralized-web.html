                                <p>You don't need a crystal ball to see how much of a game changer Web 3.0 technology 
                                    will be in the coming years - and its not hard to know what is driving this push. 
                                    Google currently handles more than 80% of search traffic in the world, Facebook 
                                    has more than 2.4 billion activate users and its projected that half of online
                                    retail will go through Amazon by 2020. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The web as we know it today is in trouble - monolithic platforms now own majority 
                                    of users, data and applications causing severe data-lock ins, data leaks, endless 
                                    manipulations and censorship. The need to re-decentralize the web has never been 
                                    greater and for small business owners, the possibilities for advertising and marketing 
                                    to potential customers with Web 3.0 technology is limitless.
                                </p>
                                <p>Although defining Web 3.0 can be tricky, its less complex for decentralized applications 
                                    (or Dapps) which are server-less applications that run on a P2P network of computers rather 
                                    than a single computer. They can be run jointly on the client side and within a distributed 
                                    network - although they don’t necessarily need to run on top of a blockchain network.
                                </p>
                                <p>In this post we'll highlight several aspects of preparing yourself and your business for 
                                    the Web 3.0:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Why Web 3.0 is the future of small business</li>
                                    <li>What will Web 3.0 adoption look like</li>
                                    <li>The bigger challenge, the bigger opportunity</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3><i>Why Web 3.0 Is The Future of Small Business</i></h3>
                                <p>For better or worse, over the last 20 years we have built softwares sophiticated enough to 
                                    cross-reference, interconnect, process and merge information from different sources to identify 
                                    patterns for web traffic, shopping patterns, emerging trends among consumers. 
                                </p>
                                <p>This ability to analyze user data and behaviour makes it possible to seemlessly provide personalized 
                                    experience in cost efficient ways and although complete Web 3.0 adoption is still a few years away, 
                                    cutting-edge businesses, particularly in retail and online media, are beginning to adopt the elements 
                                    of the decentralized web.
                                </p>
                                <p>It's inconceivable that one man can make the right decision for 2.4billion users as its expected for 
                                    Facebook's CEO, as such companies utilizing AI/ML, IOT, DLT and other features of the decentralized 
                                    web will be leading the adapility of these solutions to solve problems facing the web 2.0 such as 
                                    central points of failure, cyber-attacks, data & information manipulation and so much more. 
                                </p>
                                <h3><i>What Will Web 3.0 Adoption Look Like</i></h3>
                                <p>Although, it's not completely apparent the technological features that will make up the decentralized 
                                    web, we expect this new wave of tranformative digital landscape to include technologies like cryptography,
                                    natural learning processing programs and even side-channel defence systems. These technologies can be 
                                    analyzed in three main areas:
                                </p>
                                <h4><b>1. Applied AI/ML</b></h4>
                                <p>In the last few years, we've seen groundbreaking research and development that has facilitated the 
                                    advancement of statistical learning based AI technologies. Through this breakthroughs, engineers have 
                                    developed AI based solutions that solve a diverse range of challenges facing all sized businesses including
                                    supply chain logistical management, data modelling and analysis, communication and more. 
                                </p>
                                <p>For businesses, small and large, utilizing AI/ML based technologies will blur the line between B2B & B2C 
                                    solutions. So far we've seen businesses of all sizes and industries utilizing this technology to offer 
                                    customers complex, time-critical and personalized services for example the use of IoT to web services to 
                                    improve company supply chains and develop cross-selling opportunities.
                                </p>
                                <h4><b>2. Active Systems & Network Security</b></h4>
                                <p>Current computer systems have seen an increase of devices connectivity and with this rising connectivity 
                                    comes the threat of cyber-attacks on major systems, critical infrastructure and individual vulnerablities 
                                    that could be exploited using communication networks. Every month, we learn of hacks that result in the 
                                    exposure of personal, military and other sensitive data. 
                                </p>
                                <p>We need to build solutions that focus vast majority of security efforts on protecting computers and networks 
                                    even from attacks initiated by exploiting humans rather than security flaws. To build secure cyber systems 
                                    it will be necessary to protect computers, networks and the users that make up these systems. Businesses can 
                                    do this by building into their security systems countermeasures at the physical, circuit and logic abstraction 
                                    levels.  
                                </p>
                                <h4><b>3. Applied DLT</b></h4>
                                <p>Advancements in cryptographic encryption and signature schemes used for encrypting and authenticating data in 
                                    transit and in storage now supports various distributed ledger technologies that contribute to the decentralization 
                                    of the web. Secure computation can be used for performing computations based on encrypted or shared data while 
                                    preserving its privacy, or distributing shares of critical secret data so that no single entity has access to it.
                                </p>
                                <p>Some of the DLT based technology that will play a huge role in Web 3.0 and my personal favourites to work with 
                                    include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Distributed Money: Bitcoin</b> - For regular businesses, accepting Bitcoin payments for the goods 
                                        and services you offer can bring a great positive outcome since it has an incredible potential to 
                                        greatly reduce costs associated with transactions. It also facilitates faster international transfer
                                        at lower cost. Cases of fraud are also lower with bitcoin payment since it provides a level of identity 
                                        theft protection that credit cards are not able to offer.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Distributed File Sharing: IPFS</b> - For businesses keen on reducing costs of scaling applications, 
                                        offering web services without the risk of downtime due to centralized servers, Protocol Labs currently 
                                        provides Private Networks solutions as an experimental feature. Leveraging dedicated IPFS networks for 
                                        for your business can provide faster content discovery times for dedicated network nodes. This leads to 
                                        a better and more stable user experience for your customers.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Distributed Ledgers: Blockchain</b> - In a small business setting, the use of permissioned distributed
                                        ledgers, i.e. a blockchain, provides an advantage of a data auditlog that serves as a tool to validate facts, 
                                        reconcile information shared between other businesses and even provide broader collaboration alon a full 
                                        supply chain cycle. As a common infrastructure, a blockchain provides features which can be programmed to 
                                        determine data validation consensus, easing business governance. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>A combination of these technologies eliminates a central point of control and as a result, businesses will increase 
                                    the speed and ease of doing business and reduce risk. Businesses that implement these will quickly gain an advantage 
                                    over their competitors.
                                </p>
                                <h3><i>The Bigger Challenge & Opportunity</i></h3>
                                <p>The impending arrival of Web 3.0 could provide the game-changer for internet services and although we are already 
                                    experiencing some elements being implemented - one of the biggest challenges facing businesses is the significant 
                                    investment required to integrate these technologies into their current infrastructure. To avoid getting left behind 
                                    like Blockbuster video or kodak businesses need to recognize the opportunity of providing solutions that allow 
                                    customers to retain control of their personal data. 
                                </p>
                                <h3><i>Conclusion</i></h3>
                                <p>The journey to web 3.0 should begin by aligning business goals with technology to create a positive impact on the 
                                    immediate future and beyond current business models.
