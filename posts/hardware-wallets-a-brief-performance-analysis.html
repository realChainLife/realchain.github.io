                                <p>If you're not new to cryptocurrency then you've probably heard the popular phrase 
                                    <b>Not your keys, not your coins</b>. If you haven't this statement is often repeated 
                                    and reiterated in the crypto-community by members of the crypto awareneness event 
                                    <i>Proof of Keys</i>. The objective of this annual event is to educate cryptocurrency 
                                    holders the importance of maintaining monetary sovereignty by withdrawing all their 
                                    bitcoin and other holdings away from exchanges and other third party platforms to a wallet 
                                    they control by holding its private keys. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Over the last 10 years of Bitcoin's existence we have heard stories after stories of 
                                    exchanges being hacked, individuals losing keys to wallets, or even throwing away machines 
                                    holding bitcoin which all result in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Without learning from other people's experiences its very easy to find ourselves repeating 
                                    the mistakes of the past and that's why over the last few years, as a solution to the 
                                    problem of <b>secure cryptographic key management</b> we've seen exponential growth in 
                                    the development of hardware wallets.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Types of CryptoWallets</h2>
                                <p>Although we will mostly be covering hardware wallets in this post their are two other types 
                                    of wallets available as storage solutions for cryptocurrency holders; <b>sofware & paper</b> 
                                    wallets. Software wallets are programs that live either on your computer or on the Internet, 
                                    and paper wallets are physical documents with private keys.
                                </p>
                                <p>Hardware wallets are physical wallets with your private keys encrypted in them. These keys are 
                                    paired with a digital signature that serves as a ID that verifies ownership and ensures your
                                    private key is safe from prying hands lowering the chances of theft to near zero. 
                                </p>

                                <p>If you are considering a shift from using paper or software wallets to hardware wallets, 
                                    congratulations on taking the first step to taking possession of your assets on your journey 
                                    to monetary sovereignty. This decision is just the first step though and in the next section 
                                    we'll review some of the features to look out for prior to making a hardware wallet purchase.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Key Features to Consider</h2>
                                <p>Before jumping into my recommendations of some of the best hardware wallets to consider for 
                                    your use, its important to not only do your owe research, but to also go through some of 
                                    the key features we need to consider in our selection:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Security:</b> Encryption Protocols/safety from viruses and malware/recovery 
                                        processes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>User Interface:</b> How easy (or hard) it is to use the hardware wallet.</li>
                                    <li><b>Hardware:</b> Size / Weight, a small and manageable size is always best</li>
                                    <li><b>Pricing:</b> We weigh each wallet on the price scale balance.</li>
                                    <li><b>Currency Support:</b> We also take into consideration if the wallet supports 
                                        only Bitcoins, or other currencies as well, and if it does, how many and which!
                                    </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Now that we know which key features to consider and why, here's a performance analysis of 
                                    three of the most popular hardware wallets of 2018. We'll also explore each wallets commonly 
                                    known pros and cons.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Ledger Wallets (Nano X, S)</h2>
                                <p>The <b><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x">Ledger Nano X</a></b> is a BluetoothÂ® 
                                    enabled secure device that stores your private keys. Make sure all your crypto assets are 
                                    safe, wherever you go. With a state-of-the-art security model the Nano X ensures your private 
                                    keys are stored in a certified secure element and Bluetooth connection is encrypted. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The <b><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">Ledger Nano S</a></b> functions 
                                    with minor differences from the Nano X. The Nano S is built around a secure chip, locked by a 
                                    PIN code ensuring security. It is also fully-certified by ANSSI, the French cybersecurity agency.
                                </p>
                                <p>Both ledger wallets support 1000+ coins and have easy to use web interfaces. Ledger also allows 
                                    you to set up a recovery seed to retrieve your private keys if your device is lost or broken. 
                                    This recovery seed is a set of words that must be put together in a certain order. Ledger allows 
                                    you to recover all your lost bitcoins with your recovery seed so no need to break a sweat. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Although the device is rather small, it's still an object which means you still have to carry it 
                                    around with you like you do with your credit card or wallet. The Nano S would require an additional
                                    USB cable adaptor to function. Overall, the Ledger wallets are affordable, elegant and function 
                                    exactly as youâd want it to.</p>
                                <h2>Trezor Wallet</h2>
                                <p><b><a href="https://trezor.io/"></a>Trezor</b> was developed by SatoshiLabs, a Czech startup, and 
                                    itâs essentially a device that provides an added authentication layer to an outbound Bitcoin 
                                    transaction. Because of its design, it can be used to sign transactions even on an unsafe computer. 
                                    Itâs also impervious to keyloggers. If a host PC has been compromised, an attacker still wonât be 
                                    able to get a private key. The wallet provides support for more than 700+ currencies.
                                </p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, It lacks mobile support. As of the moment, it will only work with Linux, OS X, and 
                                    Windows. This means you can't pair your device with your tablet or mobile phone. Fortunately, 
                                    SatoshiLabs announced that itâs currently working on USB on-the-go functionality to enable Trezor 
                                    use on any Android device.
                                </p>
                                <h2>KeepKey Wallet</h2>
                                <p><b><a href="https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/">KeepKey</a></b> is one of the best secure cryptocurrency 
                                    hardware wallets 2017 that provides access to the leading cryptocurrency assets of the world today. 
                                    Because itâs an HD or Hierarchical Deterministic wallet, you can think of it as a mini computer thatâs 
                                    specifically designed to store private keys.
                                </p>
                                <p>It currently supports 7 Coins, 40+ ERC-20 Tokens and its recent price markdown has made it affordable 
                                    for users who are looking for security and value when it comes to managing cryptocurrency wallets. A 
                                    major con of the wallet is that because thereâs no web wallet, you still need to add a software like 
                                    MultiBit or Electrum in order for you to utilize KeepKey's applications. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>Every cryptocurrency hardware that we have listed above is made of high-quality materials. All of them 
                                    have features that are unique, but most importantly, they provide extremely secure storage for your 
                                    cryptocurrencies. 
                                </p>
