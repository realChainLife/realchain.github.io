                                <p>When Facebook announced its digital currency earlier this year, it had a mixed reaction 
                                    both from the crypto space and various regulatory bodies. The scrutiny that the 
                                    announcement brought on for Facebook and the wider crypto markets at large has in part 
                                    led to what can only be described as the near collapse of the entire Libra project.
                                </p>
                                <p>In this post I want to explore several topics that highlight why the Libra project is in 
                                    trouble and explore the ways, if any, Facebook might be able to save this project. We'll 
                                    cover the following:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Source of Regulatory Concern</li>
                                    <li>Understanding Partnership Disillusions</li>
                                    <li>How Facebook Can save Libra</li>
                                    <li>What Libra Without Facebook means for the Industry</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2>Source of Regulatory Concern</h2>
                                <p>For as long as cryptocurrencies have existed the regulatory question has not always 
                                    produced clear and simple answers, even during the ICO boom of 2017 we didn't get 
                                    intentional regulatory scrutiny until the tail-end of the ICO boom started. The 
                                    skepticism from government organisations only increased when Facebook first announced 
                                    its cryptocurrency project.
                                </p>
                                <p>In a filing made to the SEC, Facebook suggested the significant pushback Libra has received 
                                    from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions will impact how the product will 
                                    launch if at all, but what is the source of all this scrutiny? There have been a variety 
                                    of reasons suggested for this ranging from the bankers concerns, the competition Libra 
                                    will pose to government issued fiat and the companies previous track record in management 
                                    user private data.
                                </p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>When initially announced, Libra boasted a long list of major corporate partners in the payments 
                                    space. Earlier in October however, some of these prominent backers received cautionary letters 
                                    from U.S. senators indicating members of the Libra Association would be subjected to a high 
                                    level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra related payment activities but on all 
                                    payment activities. 
                                </p>
                                <p>As a result some of these backers announced their exit from the project including Visa, eBay, 
                                    Mastercard and Stripe. Meanwhile, none of the current Libra backers have yet made any financial 
                                    commitment to the association. This anticipated level of scrutiny also pushed Facebook to 
                                    declare that they would have to quit the Libra Association if it fails to secure the green 
                                    light for the project from U.S. regulators.
                                </p>
                                <p>Which leads us neatly along to our next section. Will we see a Libra without Facebook and is 
                                    this the only way to ensure this solution gets to the market?
                                </p>
                                <h2>How FaceBook Can Save Libra</h2>
                                <p>Finance is about trust yet Facebook's biggest challenge is its credibility gap and its seeming 
                                    inability to respect privacy rules. Libra was presented to the world as a noble solution to 
                                    bank the unbanked but the fact that Facebook took the lead role in this initiative represents 
                                    its biggest challenge. For years, technology experts have observed Facebook disregard privacy, 
                                    exploit user data and even fail to manage how this data is used by third parties.
                                </p>
                                <p>For Facebook, one of the most distrusted companies in the world, to lead the development of a 
                                    cryptocurrency and payment solution that could impact the entire global economy resulted in 
                                    calls for governments to intervene before Libra was brought to market. It's not a stretch to 
                                    presume that Libra will inherit all the problems generated by Facebook's social network and 
                                    before Facebook can separate itself from the Libra Association which seems the best thing to 
                                    do if they are to save this project; first and foremost they need to understand these key 
                                    concepts:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>The Nature of Financial Infrastructure Around The World</b>: There's still a lot of 
                                        countries in the world that still lack large-scale, efficient infrastructure that's 
                                        absolutely necessary for any economy to function competitively. Around the world, different 
                                        countries have developed different solutions that are due for updates and improvements. 
                                        The financial industry is ready for its next evolutionary step. It won't just be an 
                                        expansion on current financial infrastructure and services trends. Bitcoin as we've 
                                        come to know it is a leapfrog from other forms of currency which is the cornerstone 
                                        of financial.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>The Nature of Bitcoin</b>: Bitcoin is peer-to-peer immutable & decentralized 
                                        cryptocurrency. It has no single point of entity to control it while remaining independent 
                                        as it has nothing to do with governmental currencies. It also has a deflationary 
                                        nature due to its supply cap of 21M Bitcoins. Its a permissionless network that is 
                                        operated at one's discretion and for ten years has been maintained by a network of 
                                        volunteer developers, miners and independent users. Bitcoin is still the most valuable 
                                        cryptocurrency to date, continues to function as a currency, a medium of exchange and 
                                        a store of value.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>The Nature of Libra</b>: Unlike Bitcoin, Libra’s blockchain is permissioned which 
                                        means that transactions can only be added to it by a group of trusted parties. The 
                                        Libra Association, is what drives Libra. Each of the members are required to invest 
                                        a minimum of $10 million into the project. The currency is tied to a basket of government 
                                        backed currencies and other assets, to avoid the volatile swings often seen in 
                                        cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>While the crypto markets have made room for several permissioned blockchains to be developed and 
                                    sold as enterprise solutions, for example Hyperledger, these blockchain networks are not actively 
                                    facilitating financial transactions by issuing a currency viable as a medium of exchange. I'm 
                                    keen to see whether Libra can offer a contrasting and improved alternative similar permissioned 
                                    networks.
                                </p>
                                <h2>What Libra Without Facebook means for the Industry</h2>
                                <p>Libra is a stable coin, backed by a basket of currencies and debt securities. Bitcoin is a hyper 
                                    volatile cryptocurrency and although Libra might come to market with a lot of powerful players 
                                    behind it to help achieve mass adoption; Bitcoin is the most valuable digital currency that 
                                    began as a grass roots experiment and is ten years in the making.
                                </p>
                                <p>If and when Libra finally launches in the financial market, it will be under the assumption that 
                                    the association has passed all regulatory concerns and has received literal government approval. 
                                    At this point, its operational control can be considered closer to central bank digital currency, 
                                    or listed a security. If Libra and CBDCs become the norm its safe to assume they will be used as 
                                    a surveillance tool for governments and corporations. Whether Facebook part of the project is 
                                    yet to be seen as well as how the regulatory concessions they're yet to make will impact the 
                                    entire digital currency space.
                                </p>
