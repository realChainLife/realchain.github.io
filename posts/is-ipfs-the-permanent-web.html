                                <p><a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> the <strong>InterPlanetey File System</strong> is a global, versioned, 
                                    peer-to-peer file system. It combines good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, 
                                    and SFS. You can think of it like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging Git objects, 
                                    making up the web. IPFS provides an interface much simpler than HTTP, but has 
                                    permanence built in.
                                </p>
                                <p>Is claiming the IPFS is the permanent web a <strong>fallacy of distributed computing</strong> then?
                                    Before diving into the detailed workings of IPFS we need to discuss the HTTP protocol - 
                                    the is the most commonly known Internet Protocol. Although, I strongly believe IPFS
                                    will replace HTTP, this position is met with alot of speculation. Replacing HTTP 
                                    sounds like a ball-out-of-the-park idea yet alot of us concur the current internet
                                    model is broken and needs us to apply state of the art technology to the distribution 
                                    problem, and design a better protocol for the web.
                                </p>
                                <p>In this post, I want to focus on three thing in relation to the web design: how HTTP 
                                    works, the problems with HTTP design models and how IPFS solves this problems. Whether
                                    we realise it or not, we’re in the business of distributed computing: you probably want 
                                    that internet service you're building to make its way from one computer (a server) to 
                                    another computer (a user’s phone) over some kind of network (the internet) with minimal
                                    intermediaries.
                                </p>
                                <h2>How HTTP Protocols Work</h2>
                                <p>The <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> (HTTP) has unified the entire world into a single 
                                    global internet protocol, standardizing how we distribute and present information 
                                    to each other. Traditionally, HTTP follows a simple <i>client-server</i> model. Basically,
                                    files are accessed and retrieved based on their <i>server</i> location using a URL (Uniform 
                                    Resource Locator).
                                </p>
                                      <p>When a <i>client</i> computer across the world request a file from this server irrespective 
                                        of their location, the URL is used to find its location on a computer network and its
                                        retrieved and loaded on the client side server. But while HTTP has achieved many things, 
                                        it's usefulness as a foundation for the distribution of the sum of human knowledge is 
                                        crumbling to pieces right in front of us; For example, HTTP does not work in the offline 
                                        case or in scenarios with limited bandwidth.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>Also, the way HTTP distributes content is fundamentally flawed, and no amount of performance 
                                        tuneups or forcing broken CA SSL or anything else is going to fix that. Some of these flaws 
                                        are:
                                      </p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li><strong>HTTP Is Fragile</strong> - If you've been using the internet for any given time then 
                                          you've come across a <i>404 Error</i> or <i>Not Found Error</i>. These error occur when a 
                                          HTTP web server connection to the client server fails. This can happen if web 
                                          servers have been powered down, if the links stopped working, if the server fails 
                                          or is no longer accessible at the same location, or even the worst possible flaw,
                                          the chain between the sites becomes permanently broken, and the ability to access 
                                          that content is lost forever.
                                          
                                          <p>All these factors point to the brittleness of HTTP web servers and hightlights 
                                            the problem with HTTP: It <i>erodes</i>. When a site is no longer available on the 
                                            server at that linked location the content you're looking for is usually gone, 
                                            and it has no way to help you find it. And unless the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> 
                                            backed it up, you'll never find it again. It becomes lost, forever.
                                          </p>
                              
                                          <p>Also, the older a web page is, the more likely it is you'll see 404 pages. HTTP 
                                            is inadequate for maintaining links between sites. While all the static content 
                                            stored with the site still loads, any links offsite or to dynamically served 
                                            content are dead. Whether eroding content is <i>timelessly useful</i>, it's still our 
                                            history, and we're losing a lot of it everyday and we're losing it fast.
                                          </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>HTTP Is Fragile</strong>The web was originally designed to be 
                                          decentralized how during the peak of internet commercialization billions of users 
                                          were left dependent on a small handful of services to use. While this commercialization 
                                          propagated a lot of new internet-based service solutions centralization didn't 
                                          come without its challenges.
                              
                                          <p>Today, centralized web servers can be intercepted by multi-parties for various 
                                            reasons all affecting customer security and protection. Centralization makes it 
                                            easy for governments to <i>censor content</i> at their borders by blocking the access 
                                            to centralized sites. It also puts our communications at risk of being interrupted 
                                            by <i>DDoS attacks</i>. Customers also face the risk of <i>data breaches</i> through hackers 
                                            who can extort money for stolen data or even make it available on the black market.
                                          </p>
                              
                                          <p>Distributing the web would make it less malleable by a small handful of powerful 
                                            organizations, and that improves both our freedom and our independence. It also 
                                            reduces the risk of the <i>"one giant shutdown"</i> that takes a massive amount of data 
                                            with it.
                                          </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>HTTP Is Cost Inefficient</strong> - HTTP lowered the price of publishing, but it still 
                                          costs money, and these costs can really add up. Distributing a lot of data from 
                                          central datacenters is potentially very expensive if not done at economies of scale. 
                                          Latency and Bandwidth are the two keys to protocol performance. Latency is a measure 
                                          of the fixed costs of a transaction and does not change as documents get bigger or 
                                          smaller. Bandwidth is a measure of how long it takes to send data.
                              
                                          <p>If, for example, I had a file sized 117 Megabytes distributed and downloaded 2,344,327,696
                                            times, that means (at most) 274,286,340,432 Megabytes, or 274.3 Petabytes of data for the 
                                            file alone has been sent since it was published. If we assume a total expense of 1 
                                            cent per gigabyte (this would include bandwidth and all of the server costs), $2,742,860 
                                            has been spent on distributing this one file so far.
                                          </p>
                              
                                          <p>The cost of opening a new connection for each transaction or to serve this much data 
                                            would be astronomical, especially when bandwidth rates for small players start around 
                                            $0.12 per gigabyte and go as high a $0.20 in Asia. We need options for less expensive 
                                            bandwidth to ensure we can keep running our infrastructure at low cost.
                                          </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>HTTP Creates Overdependence on The Internet Backbone</strong> - Not only has web server 
                                          centralization made it highly dependent on the datacenter functionality model it has 
                                          also made it easy for governments to block and censor content. Even with redundancies,
                                          major architectural network backbones get damaged or go haywire each with drastic
                                          consequences to customers.
                                          
                                          <p>The point is, this architectural network design isn't perfect, it's easy to attack it, 
                                            and it's easy for services to get affected by a few important fiber lines getting cut 
                                            for example.
                                          </p>
                                        </li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p><a href="https://http2.github.io/">HTTP/2</a> is a welcome improvement, but it's a conservative update to 
                                        a technology that's beginning to show its age. To have a better future for the web, we need more 
                                        than a spiced up version of HTTP, we need a new foundation. And per the governance model of 
                                        cyberspace, that means we need a new protocol. IPFS, I'm strongly hoping, becomes that new protocol.
                                      </p>

                                      </figure>
                                      <p>To understand why I'm keen on <i>replacing</i> HTTP with IPFS as the protocol
                                        of the decentralized web, we first need to understand what it is, how it works,
                                        and how it addresses all the critical flaws currently limiting HTTP. 
                                      </p>
                                      <p>IPFS envisions a world where any resource is available via a locally mounted 
                                        filesystem at paths like:
                                      </p>
                                      <p><strong>a mutable path</strong></p>
                                      <pre>/ipns/my.host.com/some/file.txt</pre>
                                      <p><strong>or a permanent path</strong></p>
                                      <pre>/ipfs/Qmc8vVBLPjc9CXaKtFK3wiq9zoXvuB4XDeY5Xra2LmhMKg/some/file.txt</pre>
                                      <p>Files don't necessarily have to reside on the local machine to be accessible if 
                                        they exist on the IPFS, a global distributed storage system. IPFS Files in this 
                                        namespace have:
                                      </p>
                                      <ol>
                                        <li><strong>High availability</strong> - Files can be fetched from any host that stores 
                                          and is willing to provide the data.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Easy Access</strong> - The /ipns and /ipfs filesystems are usable as local 
                                          storage instead of remote servers, as in HTTP. In fact, nodes 
                                          chose which files they store locally.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Trustless</strong> - Like in git where you can trust files in a commit if you 
                                          trust the commit ID.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Signature</strong> - Files can be signed and publishers can be linked to %PATH%
                                          of publication.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Merkle-linking</strong> - You can version and back up files using the merkle-dag.
                                          Creating a merkle forest of linked data structures.</li>
                                      </ol>
                                      <p>To achieve these, IPFS integrates several successful techniques from the last 
                                        15 years of distributed systems research. Central to the IPFS design is the <i>Merkle DAG</i>, 
                                        a data structure that represents all the files. It’s like Git’s blob, tree, 
                                        and commit, except IPFS has a more flexible model: you can define what your link 
                                        structure is and how it works. This means you can implement Git on top, or a 
                                        Blockchain like Bitcoin, or linked web pages.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>IPFS is general purpose, and has little in the way of storage limitations. It can 
                                        serve files that are large or small. It automatically breaks up larger files into 
                                        smaller chunks, allowing IPFS nodes to download (or stream) files from not just 
                                        one server like with HTTP, but hundreds of them simultaneously. 
                                      </p>
                                      <blockquote class="pull-quote  pull-quote--context">
                                        <p>IPFS is The Permanent Web, where links do not die</p>

                                      <p>The IPFS network becomes a finely-grained, trustless, distributed, easily federated 
                                        Content Delivery Network (CDN). This encrypted, integrity-checked CDN can be used for 
                                        large static files including: images, video streaming, distributed databases, entire 
                                        operating systems, blockchains, and most important for us, <strong>static web sites.</strong>
                                      </p>
                                      <p>IPFS files can also be special IPFS directory objects, which allow you to use human 
                                        readable filenames (which transparently link to other IPFS hashes). Using 
                                        directory objects, IPFS allows you to make static web sites exactly the same way 
                                        you make them today. It's a single command to add your web site to an IPFS node: 
                                        <i>ipfs add -r yoursitedirectory</i>. After that, it's available from any IPFS node without 
                                        requiring you to link to any hashes in the HTML.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>IPFS has alot more features and functions that can be listed as use cases including:</p>

                                      <p>To get started with IPFS, stick around. In the next section we'll take a deep technical 
                                        dive into IPFS. I'll show you how to set up IPFS on Windows, Mac & Linux. We'll also 
                                        initialize the network and we'll add your first file to IPFS.

                                      <h2>How It Works: IPFS Deep Dive</h2>
                                      <p>To get started you need to <a href="https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs">download IPFS for your platform</a>, 
                                        by clicking <i>download go-ipfs</i>. This is a prebuilt package for the Go Implementation of the 
                                        IPFS.

                                      <p>Once the executible files have been downloaded they need to be moved to the proper location:</p>
                                      <p><strong>On Mac/Linux:</strong></p>
                                      <p>Unpack the archived folder, and move the <i>ipfs</i> file somewhere in your <i>$PATH</i>. To do this 
                                        via Terminal:

                                      <p>Before using IPFS for the first time you'll need to <i>initialize</i> the repository with the 
                                        <strong>ipfs init</strong> command:
                                      </p>
<pre>
    ipfs init

    peer identity: QmU6vXuNb6P7H8hwrbNPWiLBikrdf1d6Q9kLAhEK4Kcmub
    to get started, enter:
                              
      ipfs cat /ipfs/QmqaxZwuMiUhyvYycToWiUfMtowAPMcX9Ba8nUH4Jz3Xf2/readme
</pre>
                                      <p>The <i>repository</i> is a directory that's used by ipfs to stores all its settings and internal 
                                        data. Run the suggested output command:
                                      </p>

                                      <h3>Add Files To IPFS</h3>
                                      <p>Once <i>ipfs init</i> is completed successfully, we are ready to run a daemon and start running
                                        things online; but first we'll start by creating a directory <i>ipfsdirectory</i> and writing a 
                                        simple <i>hello.txt</i> file with the content <i>Hello World</i> 
                                      </p>
<pre>
    $ mkdir ipfsdirectory
    $ cd ipfsdirectory
    $ touch hello.txt
</pre>
                                      <p>Now we can add this file to the IPFS:</p>
<pre>
    $ ipfs add hello.txt 
                                
     added QmqaxZwuMiUhyvYycToWiUfMtowAPMcX9Ba8nUH4Jz3Xf2 hello.txt
</pre>
                                      <p>For other nodes on the IPFS network to know they can access the file from our machine, we 
                                        need to pin the file we just added:
                                      </p>
<pre>
    $ ipfs pin add QmqaxZwuMiUhyvYycToWiUfMtowAPMcX9Ba8nUH4Jz3Xf2
                              
    pinned QmqaxZwuMiUhyvYycToWiUfMtowAPMcX9Ba8nUH4Jz3Xf2 recursively
</pre>
                                      <p>Now the file no-longer exists only on our local machine.</p>
                                      <h3>Connect IPFS Node to the IPFS Network</h3>
                                      <p>By this point we have successfully downloaded, initialized, added and pinned a file on the 
                                        IPFS, however we are yet to introduce our <i>node</i> to the IPFS network. This allows other nodes/
                                        participants on the network to listen to our machine and retrieve files from our machine, 
                                        and vice versa.

                                      <pre>
                                        $ ipfs swarm peers
                                      </pre>
                                      <p>IPFS has a number of bootstrapping nodes that are actively looking for new content placed 
                                        on the network. This will be your initial connections. From here, we can access any one 
                                        of our files from their website, where they have mounted the IPFS system on their HTTP 
                                        URL: <i>https://ipfs.io/ipfs/[yourHash]</i>. In my case to check the file <i>hello.txt</i> we'll run:
                                      </p>
                                      <p>`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmqaxZwuMiUhyvYycToWiUfMtowAPMcX9Ba8nUH4Jz3Xf2`.</p>
                                      <p>Best not to forget to kill the daemon if you want to disconnect from the network. This is 
                                        pretty easy. Go to the terminal where daemon is running and press <i>CTRL+C</i>. IPFS allows 
                                        users to create new hashes with every new network launch but nodes are incentivized to remain 
                                        the same. 
                                      </p>
                                      <h2>Getting Involved With The IPFS</h2>
                                      <p>IPFS is an open-source, MIT-licensed project. Now that you've been introduced to the IPFS 
                                        basics I encourage you to <i>buidl</i> different new solutions with IPFS. It's still early, and 
                                        there's much work to do before IPFS can replace HTTP without needing to describe the idea 
                                        as crazy. But there's no time like the present to plan for the future. It's time for us 
                                        to get to work and build the permanent & distributed web. <strong>Let's Decentralize The Web.</strong>
