                                <p>In my quest for continous learning, two months ago I started studying Cryptography 
                                    a course offered by Standford University on <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a>. My 
                                    objective for taking this subject was to learn how to combine the lessons of 
                                    cryptography as a tool for protecting information and continous decentralized apps 
                                    development.
                                </p>
                                <p>It was also my intention to apply the principles of symmetric and asymmetric 
                                    cryptographic operations to provide different security properties to the softwares I 
                                    build. The use of cryptographic encryption and authentication framework is fast becoming 
                                    a necessity for modern businesses; for example, enterprises are leveraging <i>Public Key 
                                    Infrastructure</i> to authenticate users and machines.  S/MIME is proving its worth as both 
                                    an email encryption option and a way to validate email sources to counter phishing.
                                </p>
                                          <p>Before detailing how cryptographic frameworks can be used in various business solutions
                                            we need to understand what cryptography is, how it works under the hood and how 
                                            programmers can integrate it into software development. 
                                          </p>
                                          <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                          <p>Whether you know it or not, as long as you have used any service on the internet 
                                            you have interacted with Cryptographic key management or `encryption` as we will
                                            refer to it for here-on. Encryption is applied to protect electronic communications
                                            and financial transactions, maintain the privacy of sensitive data and it enables
                                            secure authentication and authorization.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Most, <i>if not all</i>, encryption lifecycles on most services start with the generation, 
                                            usage, storage, archiving, and finally the deletion of keys. What are these keys
                                            that we're referencing? A <i>cryptographic key</i> is data that specifies the transformation 
                                            of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa. Keys are typically designed to be both 
                                            random and reasonably long such that they are difficult to guess.
                                          </p>
                                          <h3>Types of Cryptographic Keys</h3>
                                          <p>In general, cryptographic keys are categorized according to their properties and uses. 
                                            The value of any key is equivalent to the value of all the data and/or assets it is 
                                            used to protect. Although there are more than 10 types of keys, today we will be covering
                                            three primary types:
                                          </p>
                                          <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Symmetric keys</strong> – these are typically used to protect bulk 
                                              <i>data-at-rest</i>. It draws its name from the fact that the same encryption 
                                              key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data and is only accessible to 
                                              authorized users i.e anyone with the secret key. 
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Asymmetric Keys</strong> – as the name suggests are a pair of keys 
                                              used for the encryption and decryption of data. Both keys are different but 
                                              related to each other and are created at the same time. They are referred to 
                                              as a <i>public</i> and a <i>private</i> keys:
                                  
                                                <ul>
                                                  <li>Public Key - this is a key used for data encryption and can be 
                                                      shared publicly.</li>
                                                  <li>Private Key - this key is used to decrypt the data encrypted
                                                      by the public key. This key must be safeguarded at all times.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                  
                                              This type of cryptography is commonly known for its usage with asymmetric 
                                              algorithms like RSA or ECDSA; in these instances, private key storage best 
                                              practises are employed since anyone with the private key can impersonate 
                                              the key owner to decrypt private data, gain unauthorized access to systems 
                                              or generate a fraudulent digital signature that appears authentic.

                                            <li><strong>Hash Keys</strong>  – these are used to safeguard the integrity and 
                                              authenticity of data and transactions with algorithms like HMAC-SHA256. If you 
                                              have used Bitcoin, other cryptocurriencies or blockchain in general then you 
                                              are familiar with a hash. 
                                               
                                              Similar to asymmetric encryption, private hash keys should not be disclosed, or 
                                              lost as mal-intended users of this key can impersonate transaction originators to 
                                              modify, falsify or create incorrect data/transactions that recipients will believe 
                                              to be authentic.
                                            </li>
                                          </ol>
                                          <h2>How Cryptographic Encryption Works</h2>
                                          <p>So far in this post we have covered what encryption is and the most common types of keys
                                            used for data protection. Without going into the historic details of encryption we will
                                            now dive deep to understand how modern encryption systems actually work.
                                          </p>
                                          <h3>Symmetric Encryption Systems</h3>
                                          <p>A historical example of symmetric encryption used by Julius Caesar: the <i>Caesar cipher</i> 
                                            is a method of shifting the alphabet by three characters. In this case the encryption and 
                                            decryption key is the number 3. The Caesar cipher is a weak form of symmetric cryptography 
                                            since anyone with this knowledge could decipher any message between Ceaser and his generals.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Thankfully, encryption has come a long way since the Caesar cipher. Using amazing math and 
                                            the help of computers, symmetric-key algorithms today can be divided into 
                                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher">stream ciphers</a> and block ciphers. 
                                            Stream ciphers encrypt bits of a message one at a time. In a synchronous stream cipher, a 
                                            stream of pseudo-random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext 
                                            messages, and then combined with the plaintext (to encrypt) or the ciphertext (to decrypt). 
                                            There’s a lot of different symmetric algorithms one can choose from including 
                                            <i><strong>Twofish, Serpent, TDES,</strong></i> and <i><strong>IDEA</strong></i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>To take it further, lets breakdown how an authorized user can access encrypted data:</p>
                                          <ol>
                                            <li>A user requests access to encrypted data.</li>
                                            <li>The client <i><strong>Key Manager</strong></i> API receives a 
                                              <i><strong>Data Encryption Key</strong></i>`` retieval request from a database 
                                              or application.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Here, once the client Key Manager API <i><strong>certificate</strong></i> has 
                                              been verified, the Key Manager must send <i><strong>its certificate</strong></i> 
                                              to the <i><strong>Key Manager API</strong></i>`` for authentication and acceptance.

                                          <h2>Asymmetric Encryption Systems</h2>
                                          <p>The critical advantage in an asymmetric key system is that users never need to send a 
                                            copy of their keys to each other. The `public key cryptography` allows someone to send 
                                            their public key in an open, insecure channel. This system also prevents third party 
                                            <i>intermediaries</i> — <strong>such as the email service providers, Internet service 
                                            providers, and those on their networks</strong> — from seeing the message content. 
                                            Theses intermediaries are restricted to <i>metadata</i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>In these systems, <strong>users can encrypt and send messages to <i>owners</i> of a public 
                                            key while also using their <i>private key</i> to decrpyt messages they receive</strong>. 
                                            Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption - and that's one of 
                                            the major benefits of this encryption system. We never need to send secret keys or passwords 
                                            over insecure network channels.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Another one of those benefits of this system is that it boasts a simple encryption-to-decryption
                                            -to-encryption process that happens in quick succession:

                                            <li>It starts once the <i><strong>Sender's certificate</strong></i> has been verified. 
                                              The <i><strong>recipient</strong></i> then sends <i><strong>their certificate</strong></i> 
                                              to the sender for <i><strong>authentication and acceptance</strong></i>.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Once the sender has received the recipients <i><strong>public key</strong></i> they 
                                              create a <i><strong>one-session-use</strong></i> symmetric encryption key and encrypts 
                                              the <i><strong>message</strong></i>.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>The <i><strong>symmetric key</strong></i> is encrypted with the senders 
                                              <i><strong>public key</strong></i> and sent to the recipient.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>The <i><strong>message</strong></i> is received as a packet and is <i><strong>decrypted</strong></i> 
                                              by the recipients private key - the recipient then decrypts the message with the <i><strong>one-session-use</strong></i>
                                              symmetric key.
                                            </li>
                                          </ol>
                                          <p>Now that we know how each encryption system works I want to cover the very vital topic of 
                                            key storage options & best practises. With an ever-increasing number of keys to protect, 
                                            and an ever-increasing value of data being protected by those keys, how do we address the 
                                            many threats that can result in a key being compromised.

                                          <h2>Key Management - the Risks & Mitigation</h2>
                                          <p>Best practice tells us that a private key should remain secure and, well…private! Should 
                                            anyone get a hold of it, depending on the certificate type, they could create phishing websites 
                                            with the organization’s certificate in the address bar, they could authenticate to corporate 
                                            networks by impersonating the owner, they could sign applications or documents as the owner, 
                                            and even read encrypted emails.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>In this section, we’ll discuss the options for private key protection and storage - but before 
                                            we can talk about security we need to know the possible threats to key management.
                                          </p>
                                          <h3>Key Management - the Risks</h3>
                                          <p>We know a single compromised key could lead to a massive data breach with consequential 
                                            reputational damage, punitive regulatory fines or loss of investor and customer confidence. 
                                            Yet, the ever-present vulnerabilities in modern computing systems, and with growing sophistication 
                                            of cyber attacks, it has never been more important, nor more challenging, to keep cryptographic 
                                            keys safe and secure.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Here are some of the major threats to consider while managing the safe storage of keys:</p>
                                          <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Usage of Keys</strong> - How keys are used across various databases or 
                                              applications can impact how safe the keys remain. For instance, <i><strong>Improper re-use of keys</strong></i> 
                                              in certain circumstances can make it easier for an attacker to crack the key.
                                              
                                              Without the proper <i><strong>rotation of keys</strong></i> i.e. if a key is over-used 
                                              then it makes the key more vulnerable especially when using older symmetric algorithms;
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Inappropriate & Inadequate Protection</strong> - This is simple, keys should 
                                              never be <i><strong>stored alongside the data</strong></i> that they protect as any data 
                                              corruption is likely to compromise the key also.
                                            
                                              Even keys stored only in server memory <i><strong>should be encrypted</strong></i> 
                                              whenever stored and only be made available in unencrypted form within a secure, offline 
                                              tamper-protected environment.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Insecure Movement of Keys</strong> - When sharing symmetric keys on a system, 
                                              the key should be <i><strong>split into multiple components</strong></i> that must then 
                                              be kept separate until being re-entered into the target system (and then the components 
                                              are destroyed). Without this extra caution, keys are at risk of being publicized.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Non-Desctruction of Keys</strong> - Keys should be <i><strong>securely deleted</strong></i>
                                              once they have expired, unless explicitly required for later use (e.g. to decrypt data). 
                                              This removes the risk of accidental compromise at some future date.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Manual Key Management</strong> - The use of a manual key management processes, 
                                              using <i><strong>paper</strong></i> or <i><strong>inappropriate</strong></i> tools such 
                                              as spreadsheets and accompanied by manual key ceremonies, can easily result in human errors 
                                              that often go unnoticed and may leave keys highly vulnerable.
                                            </li>
                                          </ul>
                                          <p>There are other physical environment security threats that need to be considered a threat and 
                                            factored in the security plan this include <i><strong>physical access controls, fire, safety, 
                                            mobile device management</strong></i> and even <i><strong>structural integrity</strong></i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <h3>Securing Encryption Key Managers</h3>
                                          <p>Now that we have hightlighted ways to the secure the physical environment in which the key 
                                            manager is housed we will naturally turn to securing the key manager itself with a hardware 
                                            security module. Some of this hardware modules are:
                                          </p>
                                          <ul>
                                              <li><strong>Cryptographic Tokens</strong> - With cryptographic hardware, the 
                                                key is generated on the hardware itself and is not exportable. This means the 
                                                private key never leaves the device, making it much more difficult for someone 
                                                to compromise.
                                              </li>
                                              <li><strong>Hardware Security Module</strong> - This is typically a server with 
                                                different levels of security protection or “hardening” of the module with tamper 
                                                evident/resistant screws and locks along with the highest sensitivity to “tamper 
                                                detection/response circuitry that wipes out all sensitive data.
                                              </li>
                                              <li><strong>Virtual Instances</strong> - In many cases, a virtual key manager can 
                                                be downloaded from a vendor in a matter of minutes and deployed in a virtual environment. 
                                                The downside, of course, is that by it’s nature of being virtual with no set physical 
                                                components, a virtual key manager’s software can only be FIPS 140-2 compliant, but not 
                                                svalidated. 
                                              </li>
                                          </ul>
                                          <p>The key storage options discussed above are somewhat traditional methods that have been used 
                                            for years. However, as more devices come online they need to authenticate and communicate securely. 
                                            We will continue turning to PKI-based solutions, which in turn bring about new considerations, 
                                            requirements and technologies for protecting private keys.

                                          <p>So now that we understand the risks and mitigations that come with encryption key management,

                                            in 2000 when <i><strong>Advanced Encryption Standard</strong></i> (AES) algorithm was formally 
                                            adopted as the standard encryption algorithm it introduced a <i><strong>single key use</strong></i> 
                                            as a part of the encryption process.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>The key can be 128 bits (16 bytes), 192 bits (24 bytes), or 256 bits (32 bytes) in length. Given 
                                            that the fastest computer would take billions of years to run through every permutation of a 256-bit 
                                            key, AES is considered an extremely secure encryption standard. Regardless, its advised to maintain 
                                            a robust encryption key management strategy even after deploying an encryption.

                                          <p>Private key storage `shouldn’t be a dark art`. Any key management system that utilizes 
                                            HSM to generate keys will not only help protect your keys, it will also boost efficiency, 
                                            reduce reliance on highly-skilled personnel, and simplify achieving, maintaining and 
                                            demonstrating compliance with a multitude of standards and regulations such as GDPR.
