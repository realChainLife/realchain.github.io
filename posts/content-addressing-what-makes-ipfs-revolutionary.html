                                <p>IPFS is an internet protocol that makes the web faster, safer, and distributed. It
                                    changes the addressing of information, moving from location addressing to content 
                                    addressing. It provides cryptographic hash content addressing, file integrity and 
                                    versioning, filesystem-level encryption and signing support by combining a series 
                                    of old and new technologies.
                                </p>
                                <p>Before diving into how content addressing on the IPFS works, lets briefly explore some
                                    feature components that set IPFS apart from other internet Protocols like HTTP:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Network</strong> - The IPFS network runs by combining more protocols 
                                        that make the connectivity integrity more reliable and authentic. These include 
                                        the transport protocols, data-channels, using uTP or SCTP, using HMAC with sender’s 
                                        public key, etc.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Objects</strong> - IPFS builds a Merkle DAG, a directed acyclic graph 
                                              which providesIPFS many useful properties like content addressing, tamper resistance 
                                              and deduplication.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Files</strong>- On top of the Merkle DAG, IPFS defines a set of objects 
                                              for modeling a versioned filesystem . This object models include  block, list, tree 
                                              & commit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Naming</strong> - IPNS is the DNS for IPFS. IPNS assigns every user a 
                                              mutable namespace at: /ipns/<NodeId></NodeId> where a user can publish 
                                              an Object to this path signed by their private keys. 
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>All the components of the IPFS can be covered in separate articles but in this post 
                                    we’ll explore how node <em>identifiers, routing</em> and <em>data disrtibution</em> works. 
                                    We will also look into `content addressing`, to find out exactly what happens when you 
                                    add a file to IPFS.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Identity, Routing, and Data Distribution</h2>
                                <p><strong>Node identification</strong> follows the scheme from S/Kademlia where nodes are 
                                    identified by a `NodeId`, the cryptographic hash of a public-key, created with S/Kademlia’s 
                                    static crypto puzzle. Nodes store their public and private keys (encrypted with a passphrase). 
                                    Basically:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Nodes in this peer to peer network each hold private keys and release public keys, 
                                        just like in Bitcoin or Ethereum.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Node addresses are derived through hashing their public keys. Allowing connection 
                                        verification through message signing.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Their public keys can be used to encrypt data before it is transferred, preventing 
                                        interception and theft.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Users are free to instatiate a “new” node identity on every launch, though that loses 
                                    accrued network benefits. <strong>Nodes are incentivized to remain the same</strong>. The 
                                    crypto-puzzle is a proof-of-work scheme that makes it hard for an attacker to quickly create 
                                    lots of identities (<em>a Sybil attack</em>).
                                </p>
                                <p>Solutions to the security issues of today’s web are built into this addressing system. 
                                    There is no need for a trusted central certificate issuer to provide connection verification 
                                    tools and all connections can easily be encrypted by default. No more SSL.
                                </p>
                                <p>For <strong>Routing</strong>> IPFS uses a Distributed Sloppy Hash Table (DSHT). DHT is a 
                                    distributed system that provides access to the key-value store. The store is spread across 
                                    the participating nodes and offers excellent performance and scalability.
                                </p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>The DHT part of the IPFS comes from Kademlia DHT as used in BitTorrent while the “sloppy” 
                                    in DSHT part comes from the Coral DSHT which relaxes the DHT API from <i>get_value(key)</i> to 
                                    <i>get_any_values(key)</i> and can work with single peer. In return, Coral can distribute only 
                                    subsets of the values to the “nearest” nodes, avoiding node hot-spots.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Data distribution,</strong> on the other hand, is based on a variant of BitTorrent called 
                                    <em>BitSwap</em>. Incentives are designed in to encourage nodes to store blocks for others, and to 
                                    prevent freeloaders. The strategy used in BitSwap to exchange information with peers is pluggable. 
                                    The choice of function should aim to:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>maximize the trade performance for the node, and the whole exchange</li>
                                    <li>prevent freeloaders from exploiting and degrading the exchange</li>
                                    <li>be effective with, and resistant to other, unknown, strategies</li>
                                    <li>be lenient to trusted peers</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>In order to have something to barter with, a node that has nothing its peers want then seeks 
                                    the pieces that its peers want, with lower priority than it seeks its own blocks. “This 
                                    incentivizes nodes to cache and disseminate rare pieces, even if they are not interested 
                                    in them directly.”
                                </p>
                                <p>The Bitswap protocol also encourages fair play by incentivizing nodes to seed even when they 
                                    do not need anything in particular, as they might have the blocks others want. Thus, BitSwap 
                                    nodes send blocks to their peers optimistically, expecting the debt to be repaid. It prevents
                                    freeloading by implementing a simple credit-like system that solves the problem by making:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Peers track their balance (in bytes verified) with other nodes. </li>
                                    <li>Peers send blocks to debtor peers probabilistically, according to a function that
                                        falls as debt increases.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>The credit system is backed up by the BitSwap nodes that keep ledgers accounting the transfers 
                                    with other nodes. This allows nodes to keep track of history and avoid tampering. When activating 
                                    a connection, BitSwap nodes exchange their ledger information. If it does not match exactly, the 
                                    ledger is reinitialized from scratch, losing the accrued credit or debt.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Content Addressing and Paths</h2>
                                <p>Content addressing is a technique to reference files or data by a unique <em>fingerprint</em> 
                                    derived from the contents of the file or data itself. Content addressing is implemented 
                                    with cryptographic hashing, so that content addresses are secure, permanent, and derived 
                                    directly from the content itself. 
                                </p>
                                <p>IPFS uses content addressing to ensure files, websites, and webapps can move around the 
                                    network and be distributed by any computer securely and with perfect fidelity. All content, 
                                    including links, is uniquely identified by its multihash checksum. Paths in IPFS are of 
                                    the format:
                                </p>
                                <pre><span>ipfs/hash-of-object/name-path-to-object</span></pre>
                                <p>IPFS is designed to allow the files of millions of users to coexist together. The DHT, 
                                    with content-hash addressing ensures fair and secure publication of objects. Nodes can 
                                    pin objects to the IPFS making them available for all peers on the network. In the process
                                    of adding and publishing objects, they run through a hash function to produce a digest. The
                                    hash produced is guaranteed to be cryptographically uniue to the contents of the object.
                                </p>
                                <p>Note that Objects are essentially immutable, just like in Git. New versions hash differently, 
                                    and thus are new objects. Basically, if the content of the file change by even one bit, the 
                                    hash is also changed. Tracking versions is the job of additional versioning objects. This 
                                    object hashing process is best illustrated in the image below, the object in this case, a
                                    cat photo.

                                <p>Currently, on the web, if a file is moved, all links to that file need to be updated if they 
                                    are to resolve. Because IPFS addresses are derived from the content they refer to, if the 
                                    content still exists anywhere on the network, links will always resolve. This removes any need 
                                    for duplication of content, except for the purposes of greater persistence security or for 
                                    scaling up serving capabilities.

                                <h3>Implications of Content Address</h3>
                                <p>Now that we understand how content addressing works, what are the implication for the web as
                                    we know it? We know that hash links permanently point to exact content and from a computer 
                                    science perspective, any time we create data that uses content-addressed links, a persistent 
                                    and permanent data structure is created. Some of the implications of storing and sharing data 
                                    this way include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Data is Never Lost</strong> - Unlike centralized servers that lose data in the 
                                        event of server failures or other limitations this decentralized, content-addressed ensures 
                                        that data will not become endangered as long as a valid copy of it exists on the IPFS peer 
                                        network.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Integrity is Maintained</strong> - Content-addressing enables us to check the 
                                        data's fingerprints against the links because the connections are resilient and reliable even 
                                        on a large scale. This kind of validation is impossible with location-addressed links.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Links Don't Die</strong> - IPFS links permanently point to their content. In the 
                                        unlikely event that entire copies of objects are destroyed, once a node re-publishes the content 
                                        all the network peers can continue to link to cryptographic hash of the object or content.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><Strong>No Single Point of Failure</Strong> - As long as at least one node on the network has 
                                        a copy of the content, it will permanently remain available. Although content can be served from 
                                        different nodes, it is cryptographically verified to ensure its not tampered with and users access 
                                        the files as originally published.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>There are alot more ways content-addressing will change the way we use the web, however, for 
                                    a decentralized storage system to grow to replace the current model, we need more ways to 
                                    incentivize the storage and serving of content in this way. One such way is changing the way we
                                    link to content - IPFS accomplishes this using a special feature called `IPNS`.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Mutable References and Human-readable names</h2>
                                <p>IPNS, the **Interplanetary Naming System** is the DNS of IPFS. To truly appreciate the 
                                    genius of IPNS, lets first explore the how content can be retrived from the IPFS. You'll
                                    need the hash of the object. Using the example of the cat photo above, we'll access the 
                                    file at `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcBsE7VjTVZKYDmkzzw3A1FVXsBb5hUqJ5BqT34Xp27m`
                                </p>
                                <p>To do this, we use a private key to sign a reference to the IPFS hash representing the 
                                    latest version of our file using its public key hash. But this approach has several 
                                    challenges:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Firstly, it’s hard to read, let alone remember.</li>
                                    <li>Secondly, it’s an immutable link. Which means its permanent. Any changes to the 
                                        content would generate a new pubkey hash which would break the link to the file.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The IPNS addresses these problems by creating human readable mutable links and by pointing 
                                    to the pubkey hash to the latest version of any object.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Human-Readable Mutable Addressing</h3>
                                <p>IPNS allows you to use the existing Domain Name System (DNS) to provide human-readable 
                                    links to IPFS/IPNS content. It does this by allowing you to insert the hash into a TXT 
                                    record on your nameserver. The name, which follows `/ipns/` in a link is the hash of a 
                                    public key. It is forever associated with the hash it links to that is signed by the 
                                    corresponding private key.
                                </p>
                                <p>Simply put, IPNS is a global namespace based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a> 
                                    (or PKI) which allows us to build encrypted and authenticated trust chains. IPFS has plans 
                                    to also support Namecoin, which could be used to create a completely decentralized, distributed 
                                    web that has no requirements for a central authority in the entire chain. No ICANN, no central 
                                    servers, no politics, no expensive certificate "authorities", and no choke points.
                                </p>
                                <h3>How we'll use IPFS/IPNS in the future</h3>
                                <p>Long-term, the IPFS can be used for storing all of our sites, and issue IPNS keys for each 
                                    site. Users will continue to publish content on the IPFS and link other users independently.
                                    This will effectively remove user dependency on centralized servers permanently changing the
                                    way we use the web today. If you ask me, this is revolutionary technology whose transforming
                                    I'm excitedly watching for.
                                </p>
