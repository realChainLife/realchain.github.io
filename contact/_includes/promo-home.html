        <h2 class="heading">Consultancy</h2>
        <p>I provide CSS and performance consultancy to companies of all
        sizes across the globe. From advice on how to work better as a
        team, to how to scale a large codebase; how to rationalise the
        design process, to how to write better quality responsive User
        Interfaces.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Development</h2>
        <p>I work on products and long-running projects, focusing on
        scalability, maintainability, performance, and more. I usually
        join product teams for short, initial kick-off sprints in order
        to set up architectures and workflows, and to leave teams self
        sufficient after Iâ€™ve left.</p>

      <li class="layout__item  lap-and-up-one-half  desk-one-third">

        <h2 class="heading">Workshops</h2> <p>I run workshops and
        training sessions for existing teams, getting them up to scratch
        and prepared for writing and managing front-ends that they
        expect to grow. Performance concerns, workflows, design process,
        and more, tailored to your company, products, and team.</p>
