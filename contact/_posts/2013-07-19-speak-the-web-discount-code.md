[Speak the Web](http://speaktheweb.org/), for those unaware, is a _fantastic_
series of micro-conferences hosted at night in various cities across the north
of England. It is an ambitious and exciting endeavour carried out through the
month of July and co-organised by my friend and all-round nice chap
[Dan Donald](https://twitter.com/hereinthehive).

I’ve been lucky enough to attend two of the three events so far (Manchester and
Nottingham) and have seen some great talks and met some lovely people, _and
there are still two events left_. Firstly there is
[the Leeds event on July 23](https://tito.io/speaktheweb/leeds), at which my
friend and absolute star [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) will
be speaking, and then there’s
[the Liverpool event on July 24](https://tito.io/speaktheweb/liverpool) at which
_I_ will be speaking!

The events are kept relatively small for a nice intimate feel, and are also
_incredibly_ affordable at only £17.50 a ticket. And, if that’s not already
cheap enough, there is also a 25%-off promo code you can use to get entry _even
cheaper_. That code is simply **csswizardry**.

So, if you’re free on the 23rd or 24th of July—and can make it to Leeds or
Liverpool respectively—then grab yourself a ticket before they’re all gone!

See you there!
