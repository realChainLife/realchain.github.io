When asked if I consider myself a leader or how I would describe leadership, 
I often agree and refer to my ***"leading by example"*** mantra for description. 
I've believed for years now that to contribute extensively to a team or a 
cause one must ensure they remain willing and helpful when resolving and 
analyzing issues. 

One must adopt a very flexible leadership style that focuses more on facilitation 
than leading from the front; this way, we prioritize the tasks and the results 
instead of methods and means.

Once in a while though one comes across a piece of literature that if engaged 
with open-mindedly results in an amazing mindset shift. One such literature 
for me was reading **"Leading from the Emerging Future"** by *Otto Scharmer* and 
*Katrin Kaufer*. I should state at this point that this is not a book review, 
this is a write up about my understanding of the *Theory of U* and how to apply 
it as a business leader in any industry. This book was recommended at the end 
of a workshop on *"Creating Sustainable Organisational Cultures"* and it is by-far 
one of the best book recommendations I've gotten to date.

Prior to suggesting interventions that innovators, entrepreneurs and business 
leaders can implement as they disrupt current systems and create a different 
future, Scharmer and Kaufer present the situation of the world as it is today. 
They highlight governance or leadership standards and styles, access to technology, 
private property ownership, ecology and the vast income and wealth distribution 
gaps. I, however, find myself having to preview all of the above from the preset 
of Africa and its own development indicators.

To be at the forefront of an emerging future, leaders and creators are compelled 
to answer how their creations solve, not just, one specific challenge but rather 
how it will integrate across multiple sectorsâ€”engaging the whole system with an 
intention to serve the highest good of all; for example the recent change of 
leadership in Zimbabwe that has been lauded for its minimal effect on the daily 
lives of people in the country that's in stark contrast with other leadership 
changes that have occurred in other parts of the continent in recent years.

The authors place great emphasis on the individual mindsets of leaders who take 
it upon themselves to create change within any or all of these functional areas 
stating that **"the success of an intervention depends on the interior condition** 
**of the intervenor."** In essence, before the commissioning of an action in an instance 
(another example the creation of a prototype), an intervenor should spend equal or 
more time in observation, retreat and reflection to allow the inner knowing to emerge.

They conclude, from their years of study, that to bring about any meaningful 
shifts, changes or disruptions then one needs to increase their awareness of the 
systems and understand the intention of the shift from the source - both of which 
can only be done through a development of deeper listening skills. They rightly 
state that leadership connects to an entire spectrum as needed by the situation.

Through the several experiences shared, they indicated how with an open mind, open 
heart, open will and openness to change one-self change makers can go from observing 
past patterns to sensing the deepest needs in a community to crystallizing vision or 
intent and finally prototyping new solutions that shift systems for the good of the 
whole.

While ***Leading by Example***, is in and of itself a good way to lead; ***Leading by*** 
***Listening*** is a call to become our most authentic self characterized by empathy, 
openness and transparency. It's a reminder that 'The way you pay attention shapes 
what emerges and in turn the future we create'. It's a call to start with U and 
practice the Theory, day after day.
