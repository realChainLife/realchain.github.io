                            <h6>The internet was initially introduced as a way to build a common neutral network
                                which everyone can participate in equally for the betterment of humanity. During 
                                the first dot-com bubble much of this altruism faded as people realized it was 
                                easier to extract value from this neutral fabric by building <b>centralized</b>
                                services which trap and monetise information. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>So what happened to the initial dream of the web? Fortunately, there is an emerging
                                movement which is intending to bring the web back to its original vision. It's the 
                                Decentralized Web or Web 3.0 and since you managed to find this page out of all the 
                                possible million others on the web, congratulations! You‚Äôre passionate about 
                                decentralizing the web - just like me! 
                            </h6>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="/img/blog-img/content-multi-hashing.png" alt="" />

                            <h6>Jason Griffey, a fellow at the <b>Berkman Center for Internet and Society at 
                                Harvard University</b> describes the Decentralized Web as a series of technologies 
                                that replace or augment current communication protocols, networks, and services and 
                                distribute them in a way that is robust against single-actor control or censorship. 
                                Simply put it's an architectural system that builds services on the internet which 
                                do not depend on any single ‚Äúcentral‚Äù organisation to function.
                            </h6>
                            <h3>What‚Äôs the Problem With Centralization?</h3>
                            <h6>For much of their existence, centralized platforms have provided solutions and 
                                services to millions of internet users, across multiple continents with easy-to-use
                                interfaces. The centralization of the internet basically started with its 
                                commercialization.  
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Without this commercialization we could argue the internet would not have survived 
                                the dot-com bubble. Users of the internet today don't just rely on it for general 
                                research or online shopping. We also use the Internet to pay bills, RSVP to 
                                invitations, work remotely with teams around the world and even internet banking. 
                                It has become a necessity for modern living.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Although the internet centralization has resulted in its expansion of service 
                                offerings its not without its shortfalls:
                                
                                1. A user‚Äôs access to the Internet is at the mercy of their provider and 
                                   the platform;
                                2. CEO's of large tech companies have turned these companies into gatekeepers 
                                   of information and we have to trust them to use their power fairly and 
                                   responsibly;
                                3. Through the creation of Terms of Service or Data Policies, internet users 
                                   are required to agree with the collection of personal data which is often 
                                   shared with `Third Parties` for monetary gain;
                                4. Disruptive tech startups today suffer a slow and painful death as tech-giants 
                                   exploit their seemingly unlimited supply of cash to copy new features - either
                                   that or accept being acquired;
                                5. Centralized architectures, require companies to own centralized servers - which
                                   expose users to serious security and privacy incidents like data breaches and
                                   hacks which occur several times a year;
                                6. These architectures are also vulnerable to Denial of Service and Distributed 
                                   Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks;
                                7. Centralized servers are single points of failure, **when they fail, websites** 
                                   **and applications that depend on them also fail**.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>A decentralized version of the internet would solve many of the problems that the 
                                current internet faces. Without a single point of failure, Web3.0 is resilient
                                against cyberattacks. Data breaches also become near impossible without central data
                                storage solutions. Users would once again have control and ownership of their data. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>It's not lost on me, or avid internet users that there's an urgency to decentralizing
                                the web. Listings the protocols and networks that will enable us to do this is
                                relatively easy. However understanding the underlying technology of each decentralized
                                protocol is usually a good deal harder. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>In this post I want to introduce some of my favorite decentralized systems, 
                                deconstruct how they work, provide workarounds to some of the substanial bottlenecks 
                                within each network (both in itself and for other resources) and finally highlight my 
                                evolution theory for each system. 
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Decentralized File Sharing - IPFS</h3>
                            <h6>To truly apprecite IPLD, we are going to learn the basics using simple IPFS command 
                                line tools. Initial IPLD support has been released in ipfs, install or update IPFS 
                                before following along on the rest of this guide. Once you‚Äôre ready, we‚Äôll take a quick 
                                look at the object structure for a simple hello.txt file using the [jq tool](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
                            </h6>
                            <h6>As illustrated above, the benefits of using a DAG to represent data in IPFS is very clear, 
                                depending on the actual contents of the files in your directory, you end up with a series 
                                of objects, linked via their CIDs. This is pretty cool and since we are referencing the
                                same content we get `deduplication` for free! 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Without going into a lot of the details that are comprehensively covered in the IPFS
                                [whitepaper](https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf),
                                I'll highlight these subsystems with a short description of each:
                            </h6>
                            <h6>* **Identities & NodeId** - Using the S/Kademlia crypto puzzle, nodes are identified
                                by a NodeId, the cryptographic hash of its public-key. Although new nodes can 
                                be created for every new IPFS launch, users are incentived to maintain the same node;
                              
                                * **Network** - Nodes on IPFS communicate through several stack features like the use 
                                of ICE NAT traversal techniques. IPFS also stores addresses as `multiaddr` formatted 
                                byte strings therefore able to function without reliance on or assumption of IP 
                                addresses. For example;
                              
                                    ```
                                    an SCTP/IPv4 connection
                                    /ip4/10.20.30.40/sctp/1234/
                                    ```
                                * **Node Routing** - For nodes to find other peers' network addresses and serve 
                                objects, IPFS uses a *Distributed Hash Table* which enables any participating 
                                node to efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.
                              
                                * **BitSwap Protocol** - In IPFS, data distribution happens through the block barter 
                                exchange. This is a BitTorrent inspired protocol where nodes have to provide direct 
                                value to each other in the form of blocks. In the marketplace each peer **is looking to acquire a set of blocks (`want_list`), and has another set of blocks to offer in exchange (`have_list`)**.
                              
                                * **Merkle Forest** - This is a map of all network objects linked cryptographically
                                through the directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG intergration allows IFPS to a)
                                uniquely identify content by its `multihash` checksum, **including links** b) detect
                                content corruption using data checksum c) deduplicating content by equating objects
                                to content and storing once.
                              
                                * **DNS Naming** - IPFS uses DNS TXT records to map a domain name to an IPFS address.
                                Users can edit DNS records, and use them to always point to the latest version of 
                                an object in IPFS. Because DNSLink uses DNS records, the names it produces are also 
                                usually easy to type and read.

                            <h6>IPFS is designed to be used in several ways and Protocol Labs has continued to expand 
                                this list. If we bundle all the possible ways IPFS could be used we can summarize to 
                                the solving of these 3 problems:

                            <h6>By intergrating great peer-to-peer technology from other successful systems - IPFS is able 
                                to provide a one-in-all-solution to decentralized file sharing. We've seen great services 
                                already developing on top of the IPFS fabric. The best is yet to come.

                            <h6>`Bitcoin`, by virtue of how it works, is not just a digital currency - it's the foundational 
                                open source network needed to decentralize economic activity both on the Web and real-world
                                trade. This is because it has six primary features that differentiate it from the private 
                                networks used by governments and traditional financial institutions:                                 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>1. It's **permissionless**;
                                * Anyone in the world can connect to the network. With resources like computing
                                  power and software users can participate in the validation of transactions.
                                2. It's **decentralized**;
                                * Through cryptographic breakthroughs, Bitcoin nodes are programmed to hold and 
                                 independently update the database in the network. 
                                3. It's **trustless**;
                                * A central party isn't required to ensure transcations are valid. 
                                4. It's **transparent**;
                                * The network is a record of transactions between blockchain addresses. Anyone 
                                  inspecting the network sees every transaction and its hash value.
                                5. It's **censorship resistant**;
                                * A central party cannot invalidate a user's transactions or reverse changes. 
                                  Also as there are nodes throughout the world it is virtually impossible for 
                                  the entire network to be taken over by a single party.
                                6. It's **programmable**;
                                * Bitcoin consists of individual behaviour specifications called protocols. The 
                                  implementation of specific protocols essentially makes it a distributed, peer-to-peer 
                                  and secured information database programmable to business logic and interoperable 
                                  financial services.

                                * costly intermediaries are scrapped. remittance fees are as low as 3%
                                * users have full custody of their wealth and can transact securely without validation
                                * with cryptograhic key management, wallets are secured using private keys for loss prevention

                                A distributed ledger, as described (briefly) earlier, is a database that is spread across 
                                several nodes or computing devices. Each node replicates and saves an identical copy of 
                                the ledger. Each participant node of the network updates itself **independently**.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Distributed ledger technologies drastically reduces the cost of trust. The architectures 
                                and structures of distributed ledgers can help us mitigate our dependence on banks, 
                                governments, lawyers, notaries and regulatory compliance officers.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>We've already seen use cases for decentralized data ledgers applied in industries like
                                [banking](https://www.r3.com/) and [insurance](https://www.everledger.io/). R3CEV tests blockchain applications 
                                for banking and aims to create a blockchain standard. In their own words, *it was born out of a common frustration with multiple generations of disparate legacy financial technology platforms that struggle to interoperate, causing inefficiencies, risk and spiraling costs*. On the other hand **Everledger** is using
                                distributed public ledger technology for tracking provenance in a way that‚Äôs more 
                                robust and accessible than a paper trail.

                            <h3>How BlockChain networks work</h3>
                            <h6>With decentralized ledgers, no one party like a bank controls its content, that is,
                                which transactions get posted (the credits and debits), which modifications are made etc 
                                as such, blockchain engineers write a series of functions to mediate transactions.
                                Member nodes in a blockchain network use a `consensus` protocol to agree on ledger 
                                content,`cryptographic hashes` and `digital signatures` to ensure the integrity of 
                                transactions.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>**Consensus** ensures that the shared ledgers are exact copies, and lowers the risk 
                                of fraudulent transactions. **Cryptographic hashes**, such as the SHA256 computational 
                                algorithm, ensure that any alteration to transaction input results in a different 
                                hash value being computed. **Digital signatures** ensure that transactions originated 
                                from senders (signed with private keys) and not imposters.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>The result of this programming is transactions that cannot be altered or reversed. This
                                is commonmly referred to network `immutability` because it requires the approval of 
                                all network participating nodes to agree on data alterations or transaction reversals.

                            <h6>The IPLD protocol is magic that runs on cryptography, math and networking. Its a single 
                                namespace for all hash-inspired protocols. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, 
                                allowing you explore data regardless of the underlying protocol. We can use it to 
                                referencea large data files using only the base CID, and you actually have a verified reference 
                                to the whole object. With the simple `ipfs add` command a new merkle DAG is created from data
                                in the files, this command also creates the underlying IPNS objects you'll need to access your
                                files. 
                                    
                                With such great technology, there's nothing stopping you from building great distributed web 
                                projects. If you're already work on one, I'd love to hear about it!
