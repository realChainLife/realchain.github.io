                            <h6>In my quest for continous learning, two months ago I started studying Cryptography 
                                a course offered by Standford University on [Coursera](https://coursera.org). My 
                                objective for taking this subject was to learn how to combine the lessons of 
                                cryptography as a tool for protecting information and continous decentralized apps 
                                development.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>It was also my intention to apply the principles of symmetric and asymmetric 
                                cryptographic operations to provide different security properties to the softwares
                                I build. The use of cryptographic encryption and authentication framework is fast
                                becoming a necessity for modern businesses; for example, enterprises are leveraging 
                                `Public Key Infrastructure` to authenticate users and machines.  S/MIME is proving 
                                its worth as both an email encryption option and a way to validate email sources 
                                to counter phishing.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Before detailing how cryptographic frameworks can be used in various business solutions
                                we need to understand what cryptography is, how it works under the hood and how 
                                programmers can integrate it into software development. 
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <h6>Whether you know it or not, as long as you have used any service on the internet 
                                you have interacted with Cryptographic key management or `encryption` as we will
                                refer to it for here-on. Encryption is applied to protect electronic communications
                                and financial transactions, maintain the privacy of sensitive data and it enables
                                secure authentication and authorization. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Most, *if not all*, encryption lifecycles on most services start with the generation, 
                                usage, storage, archiving, and finally the deletion of keys. What are these keys
                                that we're referencing? A `cryptographic key` is data that specifies the transformation 
                                of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa. Keys are typically designed to be both 
                                random and reasonably long such that they are difficult to guess. 
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Types of Cryptographic Keys</h3>
                            <h6>In general, cryptographic keys are categorized according to their properties and uses. 
                                The value of any key is equivalent to the value of all the data and/or assets it is 
                                used to protect. Although there are more than 10 types of keys, today we will be covering
                                three primary types: 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>1. **Symmetric keys** ‚Äì these are typically used to protect bulk *data-at-rest*. 
                                It draws its name from the fact that the same encryption key is used to both 
                                encrypt and decrypt the data and is only accessible to authorized users i.e
                                anyone with the secret key. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>2. **Asymmetric Keys** ‚Äì as the name suggests are a pair of keys used for the 
                                encryption and decryption of data. Both keys are different but related to 
                                each other and are created at the same time. They are referred to as a 
                                `public` and a `private` keys:
                             
                                 * Public Key - this is a key used for data encryption and can be 
                                   shared publicly.
                             
                                 * Private Key - this key is used to decrypt the data encrypted
                                   by the public key. This key must be safeguarded at all times.
                             
                                 This type of cryptography is commonly known for its usage with asymmetric 
                                 algorithms like RSA or ECDSA; in these instances, private key storage best 
                                 practises are employed since anyone with the private key can impersonate 
                                 the key owner to decrypt private data, gain unauthorized access to systems 
                                 or generate a fraudulent digital signature that appears authentic.

                            </h6>
                            <h6>3. **Hash Keys**  ‚Äì these are used to safeguard the integrity and authenticity of 
                                data and transactions with algorithms like HMAC-SHA256. If you have used Bitcoin,
                                other cryptocurriencies or blockchain in general then you are familiar with a hash. 
                             
                                Similar to asymmetric encryption, private hash keys should not be disclosed, or 
                                lost as mal-intended users of this key can impersonate transaction originators to 
                                modify, falsify or create incorrect data/transactions that recipients will believe 
                                to be authentic.

                            <h3>How Cryptographic Encryption Works</h3>
                            <h6>So far in this post we have covered what encryption is and the most common types of keys
                                used for data protection. Without going into the historic details of encryption we will
                                now dive deep to understand how modern encryption systems actually work.                                
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Symmetric Encryption Systems</h3>
                            <h6>A historical example of symmetric encryption used by Julius Caesar: the `Caesar cipher`
                                is a method of shifting the alphabet by three characters. In this case the encryption 
                                and decryption key is the number 3. The Caesar cipher is a weak form of symmetric 
                                cryptography since anyone with this knowledge could decipher any message between Ceaser 
                                and his generals.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Thankfully, encryption has come a long way since the Caesar cipher. Using amazing math 
                                and the help of computers, symmetric-key algorithms today can be divided into [stream ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher) and block ciphers. Stream ciphers encrypt bits of a message one at 
                                a time. In a synchronous stream cipher, a stream of pseudo-random digits is generated 
                                independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the 
                                plaintext (to encrypt) or the ciphertext (to decrypt). There‚Äôs a lot of different symmetric 
                                algorithms one can choose from including ***Twofish***, ***Serpent***, ***TDES***, and ***IDEA***.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>To take it further, lets breakdown how an authorized user can access encrypted data:

                                1. A user requests access to encrypted data.
                                2. The client `Key Manager` API receives a `Data Encryption Key` retieval request 
                                   from a database or application.
                                3. Here, once the client Key Manager API `certificate` has been verified, the Key 
                                   Manager must send `its certificate` to the `Key Manager API` for authentication
                                   and acceptance. 
                                4. A `secure TLS connection` is opened between the client KM API & the KM once the 
                                   certificates have been accepted.
                                5. The KM API sends a decrypted `Data Encryption Key` (*that was received over the encrypted TLS session*) 
                                   to the database or application.
                                6. A DEK cached in a `temporary secure memory` lets the database or application `send` 
                                   `the plaintext` information to the user.                               
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Symmetric cryptography however doesn‚Äôt address several issues for example:

                                * How does the sender send the symmetric decryption key to the 
                                  recipient without someone spying on that conversation too? 
                              
                                * What if the sender and recipient are physically far away from 
                                  each other?

                            <h3>Asymmetric Encryption Systems</h3>
                            <h6>The critical advantage in an asymmetric key system is that users never need to send a 
                                copy of their keys to each other. The `public key cryptography` allows someone to send 
                                their public key in an open, insecure channel. This system also prevents third party 
                                `intermediaries` ‚Äî *such as the email service providers, Internet service providers, 
                                and those on their networks* ‚Äî from seeing the message content. Theses intermediaries 
                                are restricted to `metadata`. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>In these systems, **users can encrypt and send messages to `owners` of a public key while also using their `private key` to decrpyt messages they receive**. Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for 
                                encryption and decryption - and that's one of the major benefits of this encryption 
                                system. We never need to send secret keys or passwords over insecure network channels.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Another one of those benefits of this system is that it boasts a simple encryption-to-decryption-to-encryption
                                process that happens in quick succession:
                                
                                  1. It starts once the `Sender's certificate` has been verified. The 
                                     `recipient` then sends `their certificate` to the sender for 
                                     `authentication and acceptance`.
                                  2. Once the sender has received the recipients `public key` they create 
                                     a `one-session-use` symmetric encryption key and encrypts the `message`.
                                  3. The `symmetric key` is encrypted with the senders `public key` and 
                                     sent to the recipient.
                                  4. The `message` is received as a packet and is `decrypted` by the recipients 
                                     private key - the recipient then decrypts the message with the `one-session-use` 
                                     symmetric key. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Now that we know how each encryption system works I want to cover the very vital topic 
                                of key storage options & best practises. With an ever-increasing number of keys to protect, 
                                and an ever-increasing value of data being protected by those keys, how do we address the 
                                many threats that can result in a key being compromised.

                            <h3>Key Management - the Risks & Mitigation</h3>
                            <h6>Best practice tells us that a private key should remain secure and, well‚Ä¶private! Should 
                                anyone get a hold of it, depending on the certificate type, they could create phishing websites 
                                with the organization‚Äôs certificate in the address bar, they could authenticate to corporate 
                                networks by impersonating the owner, they could sign applications or documents as the owner, and 
                                even read encrypted emails.                                
                            </h6>
                            <h6>In this section, we‚Äôll discuss the options for private key protection and storage - but before we 
                                can talk about security we need to know the possible threats to key management.
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Key Management - the Risks</h3>
                            <h6>We know a single compromised key could lead to a massive data breach with consequential reputational 
                                damage, punitive regulatory fines or loss of investor and customer confidence. Yet, the ever-present 
                                vulnerabilities in modern computing systems, and with growing sophistication of cyber attacks, it has 
                                never been more important, nor more challenging, to keep cryptographic keys safe and secure. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Here are some of the major threats to consider while managing the safe storage of keys:

                                * **Usage of Keys** - How keys are used across various databases or applications
                                  can impact how safe the keys remain. For instance, `Improper re-use of keys` in 
                                  certain circumstances can make it easier for an attacker to crack the key.
                              
                                  Without the proper `rotation of keys` i.e. if a key is over-used then it makes 
                                  the key more vulnerable especially when using older symmetric algorithms;
                              
                                * **Inappropriate & Inadequate Protection** - This is simple, keys should never
                                  be `stored alongside the data` that they protect as any data corruption is likely 
                                  to compromise the key also.
                              
                                  Even keys stored only in server memory `should be encrypted` whenever stored 
                                  and only be made available in unencrypted form within a secure, offline tamper-
                                  protected environment.
                              
                                * **Insecure Movement of Keys** - When sharing symmetric keys on a system, the 
                                  key should be `split into multiple components` that must then be kept separate 
                                  until being re-entered into the target system (and then the components are destroyed). 
                                  Without this extra caution, keys are at risk of being publicised.
                              
                                * **Non-Desctruction of Keys** - Keys should be `securely deleted` once they 
                                  have expired, unless explicitly required for later use (e.g. to decrypt data). 
                                  This removes the risk of accidental compromise at some future date.
                              
                                * **Manual Key Management** - The use of a manual key management processes,
                                  using `paper` or `inappropriate` tools such as spreadsheets and accompanied 
                                  by manual key ceremonies, can easily result in human errors that often go 
                                  unnoticed and may leave keys highly vulnerable.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>There are other physical environment security threats that need to be considered a threat 
                                and factored in the security plan this include ***physical access controls***, ***fire*** 
                                ***safety***, ***utilities failure***,
                                ***mobile device management*** and even ***structural integrity***.

                            <h3>Securing Encryption Key Managers</h3>
                            <h6>Now that we have hightlighted ways to the secure the physical environment in which the key 
                                manager is housed we will naturally turn to securing the key manager itself with a hardware 
                                security module. Some of this hardware modules are:
                            </h6>
                            <h6>* **Cryptographic Tokens** - With cryptographic hardware, the key is generated on 
                                the hardware itself and is not exportable. This means the private key never leaves 
                                the device, making it much more difficult for someone to compromise. 
                            
                                * **Hardware Security Module** - This is typically a server with different levels 
                                of security protection or ‚Äúhardening‚Äù of the module with tamper evident/resistant 
                                screws and locks along with the highest sensitivity to ‚Äútamper detection/response 
                                circuitry that wipes out all sensitive data.
                            
                                * **Virtual Instances** - In many cases, a virtual key manager can be downloaded
                                from a vendor in a matter of minutes and deployed in a virtual environment. The 
                                downside, of course, is that by it‚Äôs nature of being virtual with no set physical 
                                components, a virtual key manager‚Äôs software can only be FIPS 140-2 compliant, 
                                but not validated.

                            <h3>Asymmetric Encryption Systems</h3>
                            <h6>To truly apprecite IPLD, we are going to learn the basics using simple IPFS command 
                                line tools. Initial IPLD support has been released in ipfs, install or update IPFS 
                                before following along on the rest of this guide. Once you‚Äôre ready, we‚Äôll take a quick 
                                look at the object structure for a simple hello.txt file using the [jq tool](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Start with the following command, which pipes (|) the result from getting the IPFS 
                                object to the jq command.
                                    
                                    ipfs object get QmJTB2qXtFCfLarActp7tDNikE4PdsgaTQW2WQi7j6c7Ug | jq
                                    
                                Producing the following output:
                                    
                                    {
                                        "Links": [
                                           {
                                            "Name": "hello.txt",
                                            "Hash": "Qm34sdwMe9USZ7nS1YhWrCiS4gz7Xiud286K6pohQcTKYq",
                                            "Size": 181100
                                           }
                                        ],
                                        "Data": "\b\u0001"
                                    }
                                    
                                    
                                This is pretty cool, but let‚Äôs say you had the following directory structure, and you 
                                wanted to add it to IPFS:
                                
                                    test_directory/
                                        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bigfile.js
                                        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *hello.txt
                                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_directory
                                           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *test_file.txt
                                           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *test.txt
                                    
                                Here, we assume that all three files with an asterisk (*)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`hello.txt`, `test_file.txt`, 
                                and `test.txt`‚Äî contain the same text: `‚ÄúHello World!/n‚Äù`. Now let‚Äôs add them to IPFS:
                                    
                                    ipfs add -r test_directory/
                                    
                                The newly created DAG for your upload will look similar to this:
                                    
                                    <figure>
                                        <img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/new-dag.png" alt="" />

                                As illustrated above, the benefits of using a DAG to represent data in IPFS is very clear, 
                                depending on the actual contents of the files in your directory, you end up with a series 
                                of objects, linked via their CIDs. This is pretty cool and since we are referencing the
                                same content we get `deduplication` for free! 
                                    
                                Important to note our bigfile.js, been chunked into three smaller pieces, each of which has 
                                its own CID, which together form the larger file. Following all of these CIDs up the tree, 
                                will give you a CID that describes the contents below it. This is **the genius of IPLD.**
                                    
                                This collection of Data and Links across the IPFS network creates a graph-like object 
                                structure - commonly referred to as the **Merkle Forest** by **Juan Benet**. This data structure
                                is highly tamper proof, because all content its `hash-verified` And since we are hashing the 
                                contents of the objects, we have no duplication, because in the Merkle DAG, all objects that 
                                hold the same content are considered equal and therefore stored only once because their hash 
                                values are the same
                            </h6>
                            <h6>We can demonstrate this further by using [Matt Zumwalt's](https://github.com/flyingzumwalt/decentralized-web-primer/tree/master/samples) building out files-as-dags lesson tutorial. We will `ipfs cat` the cosmos.jpg file 
                                from the command line:

                                Now you can add it locally, and if you `cat`‚Äôd it initially, make sure the hashes match 
                                then assign the returned hash to the env variable hash:
                                    
                                    hash=`ipfs add -q cosmos.jpg`
                                    echo $hash
                                    
                                The CID output should match the image hash like this:
                                    
                                    QmWNj1pTSjbauDHpdyg5HQ26vYcNWnubg1JehmwAE9NnU9
                                    
                                Now, that the file has been chunked we can query all the ipfs objects for the image by 
                                running: 
                                    
                                    ipfs ls -v $hash
                                    
                                Each linked object is about 256k, together these chunks make up the whole image - and 
                                when a network request for this file is made, different peers share a different chunk of 
                                the image which is put together by the requesting peer. 
                                    
                                    Hash                                           Size   Name

                                You can also use this super new and fun tool to explore DAGs (IPLD obejcts) in the browser. 
                                Check out the git example for a fun one. Or even better, explore the above DAG object.
                                    
                                Now, just to show you that the above four chunks do indeed make up the single image, you can 
                                use the following code to ‚Äòmanually‚Äô join the chunks together to create the image file‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich 
                                is essentially what cat is doing in the background when you reference the base CID:
                                    
                                    ipfs cat \

                                Alternatively, you could do this more succinctly using pipes again:
                                    
                                    ipfs refs $hash | ipfs cat > test.jpg ; open test.jpg
                                    
                                There you go. It‚Äôs links all the way down. And on top of that we‚Äôve learned a few many IPFS 
                                command-line tools to manipulate IPFS DAG objects. Handy!

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <h6>The IPLD protocol is magic that runs on cryptography, math and networking. Its a single 
                                namespace for all hash-inspired protocols. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, 
                                allowing you explore data regardless of the underlying protocol. We can use it to 
                                referencea large data files using only the base CID, and you actually have a verified reference 
                                to the whole object. With the simple `ipfs add` command a new merkle DAG is created from data
                                in the files, this command also creates the underlying IPNS objects you'll need to access your
                                files. 
                                    
                                With such great technology, there's nothing stopping you from building great distributed web 
                                projects. If you're already work on one, I'd love to hear about it!
