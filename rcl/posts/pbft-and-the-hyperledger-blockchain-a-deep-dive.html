        <p>Blockchain networks are designed as peer-to-peer systems that don‚Äôt have 
            centralized authority points to function but for the decentralized infrastructure
            to exist and work, they need an in-built decision-making feature commonly 
            known as `consensus`. When implemented, consensus algorithms allow every 
            member of the network to partcipate in the blockchain development by making 
            decisions on the network's future.
