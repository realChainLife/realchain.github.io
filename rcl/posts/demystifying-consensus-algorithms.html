                            <h6>One of my absolute all time favourite topics to write about, **Consensus Algorithms**
                                Before diving into the definitions, types and differences between each consensus
                                algorithm, we need to know more about the technology that these scripts are written 
                                for and function within i.e. **blockchain technology**.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>`Blockchain` is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between 
                                two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. Generally it is a 
                                system for maintaining distributed ledgers by using peer-to-peer protocols. 
                                Blockchain enables real-time transactions and securely shares tamper-proof data 
                                across a trusted business network. 
                            </h6>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/commit-message-small.png" alt="" />

                            </figure>
                            <h6>No consensus algorithm is perfect, they all have their pros and cons and for blockchain
                                networks, one of the major functions of a consensus algorithm is to prevent double
                                spend; another is to store transaction data in distributed ledgers. Depending on 
                                the algorithm - a network can build either a `permissioned` or `permissionless` 
                                distributed ledger.

                                     <h6>**Permissioned** networks are closed ecosystems where validators are vetted 
                                         and selected by the network owner. This include *Hyperledger* and *Corda*.
                                     </h6>
                                     <h6>**Permissionless** networks allow anyone with the computational resources 
                                         to read the chain and write new blocks according to the consensus rules. 
                                         It's also known by its widest description as a public blockchain and its
                                         what we'll be covering alot of today. 
                                     </h6>
                            </h6>
                            
                            <h6>Before we can delve into each of the algorithms we need to understand some
                                of the base functionalities and mechanisms of these consensus algorithms.
                                For instance to ensure transaction validation, protocols need to follow
                                a simple three-step process of `endorsing`, `ordering` and `validating`
                                transactions. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Because blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer network - participants 
                                (developers, miners, exchanges, users) need a decision-making model that
                                is not only open or logical, it needs to be fair and balanced. This
                                model is what is referred to as a consensus `mechanism`.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>It usually covers 6 critical participant agreements on: **collaboration**,
                                **co-operation**, **equal-rights**, **participation** and **activity**. All
                                these will be covered in detail as we go through each algorithm starting
                                here with `Proof-Of-Work`. 
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Proof-Of-Work (PoW) Algorithm</h3>
                            <h6>PoW or as commonly referred, the `Bitcoin algorithm`, works on a technological
                                principle that requires all nodes (*miners*) to confirm all of their transactions 
                                and produce relevant blocks to the network chain. New blocks come with a Hash 
                                Function, and the hash function of the previous block. This provides the 
                                network an added layer of protection and prevents any type of violations.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>In proof of work, miners compete to add the next block (a set of transactions)
                                in the chain by racing to solve a extremely difficult cryptographic puzzle. 
                                Once a miner solves the puzzle, a new block gets created, and the transaction 
                                is confirmed.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin have adopted this model for their 
                                network and although a masterpiece in its own right, proof of work isn't
                                quite perfect.
                            </h6>
                            <h4>Where The Proof of Work Consensus Algorithm Falls Short</h4>
                            <h6>Far from what we can assume was Satoshi Nakamoto's vision, Bitcoin today has
                                evolved into a `datacenter-hosted style mining operation`. This is because of 
                                the high computational power required to solve cryptographic puzzles during
                                the creation of new blocks. As a result people and organizations that can 
                                afford faster and more powerful `ASICs` usually have better chances of mining 
                                than the others.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>While environmentalists argue that this level of energy consumptions is killing 
                                the planet as its slowing the migration to other sources of energy - the PoW
                                model is getting more `energy-efficient` as a result of technological innovation. 
                                Therefore, the energy consumption of bitcoin will only improve with time.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Another challenge that has been noted as a result of the high computational 
                                resource requirement is the `centralization of miners` i.e. a small pool of
                                miners controling a large part of the network. Although it might seem this way,
                                bitcoin is used by millions across the world - and any changes to the network
                                will not be implementated as easily as it's often thought. It is also extremely
                                costly to implement changes on the network.
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) Algorithm</h3>
                            <h6>PoS is a new type of concept where every individual can mine or even validate 
                                new blocks only based on their coin possession. A user with a specific amount 
                                of coins stored previously in the wallet qualify to be a node on the network.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>To qualify to be a miner users are required to deposit a certain amount of coin, 
                                after a vote is held to choose the network validators. At the end the miners 
                                stake the minimum amount required for the special wallet staking.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>The tedious solving of cryptographic puzzles in PoW is replaced with a block
                                validation process that starts off with validators identifying blocks which 
                                they think will be added to the chain. They validate these block by placing
                                a `bet` on it. For every block staked, validators receive a reward proportionate 
                                to their `bets` for example a 10% stake is rewarded by validating 10% of new blocks.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>The major grep with this consensus algorithm is due to its seemingly `minimal`
                                requirements for validator roles - What is to discourage validators from creating 
                                two blocks and claiming two sets of transaction fees? And what is to discourage
                                a signer from signing both of those blocks? This has been called the 
                                `'nothing-at-stake'` problem and its yet to be addressed by common users of the
                                algorithm including Ethereum (which recently made the switch from PoW) or PIVX.
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) Algorithm</h3>
                            <h6>PoA was proposed by a group of developers in March 2017, and was first released as
                                new network named Kovan a primary test network available on Ethereum. Since its
                                release its been optimized and used a core governance model on new networks like
                                `VechainThor`. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>This model leverages identity as the form of stake where validators are pre-approved 
                                to validate transactions and blocks within the respective network. Originally it was
                                thought it worked best with a small number of validators (`less ~25`) but on Vechain
                                they increased the number of `Authority Masternodes` to 101. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>Like other consensus algorithms designed after PoW, PoA networks run on low requirement 
                                of computational power, no requirement of communication between nodes to reach consensus, 
                                and continuity of the network is independent of the number of the available nodes since 
                                they are pre-approved and verifiably trustable through cross verification.
                            </h6>
                            <h6>These characteristics feed into the fairly obvious advantages of the PoA algorithm. PoA
                                based networks enjoy increased efficiency in transaction times and overall network 
                                consensus. This model is also much more effective with decentralized applications
                                and is easily scalable compared to other decentralized networks.
                            </h6>
                            <h3>Delegated Proof-Of-Stake (DPoS) Algorithm</h3>
                            <h6>Developed by [Daniel Larimer](https://bytemaster.github.io/) for use in the EOS network 
                                token hodlers don‚Äôt vote on the validity of the blocks themselves, but vote to elect 
                                delegates to do the validation on their behalf. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>The system is quite robust and adds a different form of flexibility to the whole equation.
                                By replacing miners or validators with delegates this system of block production ensures 
                                all levels of protection aganist regulatory problems. Blocks can also be produced at a
                                fraction of time significantly smaller that PoW networks. 
                            </h6>
                            <h6>The partial centralized nature of this type of network is a major drawback for some users 
                                of decentralized systems.

                            <h3>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) Algorithm</h3>
                            <h6>PBFT was made famous for it use in the `Hyperledger`, `Stellar` and `Ripple`
                                blockchains. It was designed as a solution to a problem presented by the
                                previous use of BGP (*Byzantine Generals Problem*). The algorithm is designed for 
                                asynchronous consensus where all the nodes inside the system get arranged 
                                in a specific order. One node is selected as the primary one, and others 
                                work as the backup plan. However, all the nodes inside the system work 
                                in harmony and communicate with one another.
                            </h6>
                            <h4>PBFT & The Hyperledger Blockchain</h4>
                            <h6>PBFT algorithms share some interesting facts with us. I will write an in-depth
                                article on how Hyperledger uses PBFT to run the network but for the moment I 
                                will highlight some of the benefits associated with PBFT and why it was the 
                                algorithm of choice for Hyperledger:

                                <h6>***Block Transaction Confirmation***
                                    PBFT uses a system of checks and balances during the lifecycle of a 
                                    transaction including the usage of endorsement policies to dictate 
                                    the members that must endorse a certain transaction class. Once 
                                    nodes agree on a specific block, it gets finalized. This is due to 
                                    the fact that, all the authentic nodes communicate with each other 
                                    and come to an understanding of the specific block.
                                </h6>
                                <h6>***Higher Transaction Throughput***
                                    Hyperledger requires all participants to be authenticated, due to 
                                    its permissioned implementation nature, as a result, the network 
                                    tends to provide higher transaction throughput rates and performance.
                                </h6>
                                <h6>***Reduction in Energy Consumption***
                                    The PBFT algorithm offers a good amount of reduction in consumption 
                                    of power than PoW. This is because not every miner is solving the 
                                    typical hashing algorithmic puzzles. That‚Äôs why the system doesn‚Äôt 
                                    require high computational resources.
