You’ve probably already seen the tweets and the blog posts about—and hopefully
already bought and read—the new [Smashing
Book](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-new-perspectives/), but
I’m really pleased about it, so I want to add my own to the list.

Earlier this year I was contacted by Vitaly and asked if I’d like to contribute
a chapter to Smashing Magazine’s latest book, <cite>The Smashing Book 4: New
Perspectives On Web Design</cite>. I’d never been in print before (not properly,
anyway), so I leapt at the chance.

My chapter, somewhat unsurprisingly, covers CSS and front-end architecture, and
new, pragmatic, and modern approaches to writing and scaling CSS for today’s
Web. It’s the first chapter in a book crammed with stellar insights from people
far cleverer than I. I feel honoured to be a part of it.

It’s a big ol’ book—just shy of 500 pages—full of practical insights from some
really, really great authors, and—at less than $50—is a total bargain!
