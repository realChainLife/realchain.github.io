workshop was nothing short of fantastic, and a real eye-opener, helping our team
level up their scalable CSS architecture skills. The entire team left it
learning something new, and to say that what was covered will have a large
impact on our work is an understatement. We can’t recommend him enough.</p><b

For many years now, I have worked as an independent consultant, helping some of
the biggest companies in the world to improve their products by providing
consultancy, audits, code, workshops, and more.

With a strong focus on performance and efficiency, my work aims to leave
companies with faster code and faster teams.

Thinking of hiring me? [You’re in good company](/#section:clients).
