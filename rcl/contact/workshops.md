A large part of my working life is spent running workshops and training events
for clients all over the globe. From the smallest of independent companies, to
organisations with over 300,000 employees, I have taught hundreds of people how
to write better, more scalable, more maintainable CSS, and how to make
substantial savings on their load times.

I aim to customise in-house training and workshops to ensure that your team get
the most relevant and pertinent information possible, so before we work together
I will ask a series of questions (either via email or on a call) to see where
you’re currently at, where you need to be, and what you want to know. My main
areas of expertise are front-end performance and CSS architecture, and clients
often opt to run a hybrid of the two. It’s entirely up to you.

With a truly international reputation, my workshops have been delivered from New
Zealand to Romania, Uruguay to the US: you’re in good hands.

Workshop clients include: Google, General Electric, Etsy, Kickstarter, the BBC.

## Front-end Performance

<a href="https://gum.co/perfmatters" class="gumroad-button">Buy the Slides</a>

My front-end performance knowledge is incredibly extensive. I’ve helped
billion-dollar companies to make tangible performance improvements that have
made notable impact on their bottom line. During our time together, your team
will learn:

* the moral and business impact of good performance;
* how the network really works, and how to play to its strengths and weaknesses;
* how to optimise our assets for most effective delivery;
* how to trick the browser into downloading things ahead of time;
* how to detect and troubleshoot performance issues;
* how to measure performance successes;
* how to prepare for the performance landscape of tomorrow;
* and much, much more.

The amount of content in this workshop cannot be overstated, so expect intense
and very full days.

  <p>We hired Harry to provide performance consultancy on a high
  profile and highly trafficked website for one of Europe’s most recognised
  authorities. His detailed and intricate knowledge of how the network and the
  browser work allowed him to improve performance by over 400%, all without
  sacrificing or removing any assets or features from any of the website. By
  analysing how the site was put together, and how browsers were dealing with
  it, he managed to optimise and restructure things in such a way that load
  times went from around 6.25 seconds to just 1.5.</p>

My performance work has been implemented on very highly trafficked and
high-availability websites, making dramatic improvements to page speed without
sacrificing the quality or integrity of any of the website’s content or assets.

## CSS Architecture

Despite having a keen focus on performance, I made my name inventing and
pioneering many of the techniques that developers use to write, scale, and
manage large CSS projects. I’ve helped some of the planet’s largest
organisations to get a handle on their CSS. Expect to learn:

* how to refine the design process to aid our architectural efforts;
* how to modularise and decompose UI components in both designs and code;
* strict naming conventions to make code more self-documenting;
* the ITCSS architecture for scalable and maintainable CSS;
* how to handle layout in a responsive world;
* theming and customising views;
* effective and business-friendly strategies for refactoring CSS;
* and a whole host more.

  <p>We loved having Harry at Kickstarter! His CSS workshop was tremendously
  helpful in getting our design team ready for our own CSS overhaul, and his
  visit left us with some much needed guidance and motivation. He’s a great
  communicator with great ideas, and he really knows how to get a team on the
  same page.</p>

I have run CSS architecture workshops for some of the world’s largest and most
well known companies—why not add yourself to the list?
