I provide on-site consultancy and development work for companies and teams of
all sizes. Need help starting a new project? Let me help you get set up.
Struggling to work out why pages feel so slow? Let’s work it out.

Consultancy clients include: the United Nations, the NHS, Sky, Unilever, the
Financial Times.

Consultancy work normally—although certainly not always—happens toward the
beginning of a project: I come in, speak with the business to learn about what
your requirements are, then work with developers to set up architectures,
frameworks, and approaches that help us to satisfy those requirements.

After this initial engagement, it is not uncommon for clients to open a
retainer, so that I can be called in periodically to either review progress, or
assist with tricky or troublesome roadblocks.

Consultancy engagements are usually very specific to the client and project, so
it’s always best to open a discussion as early as possible to work out exactly
what you need, and how much of it.

## Development

Consultancy work often involves some development work on my part (proofs of
concept, initial architecture, sprint-zero work, etc.), but most of the time is
spent discussing and planning.

If you’d like me to provide more long-term and more involved development work,
that is something that I am open to discussing for the right team and the right
product.

Development clients include: Sky, NHS.
