It looks as though your device is offline. Not to worry; I’ve prepared some
offline content for you to read whilst you wait for your connection to come
back:

* [head to the homepage](/);
* [read a little more about CSS Wizardry](/about/);
* [learn about the services I offer](/services/);
* [see how I helped Ocado level up their CSS skills](/case-studies/ocado-workshop/), or;
* [find out how best to get in touch with me](/contact/).

Or if you’d like to read something:

* [Cache-Control for Civilians](/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/)
* [CSS and Network Performance](/2018/11/css-and-network-performance/)
* [Image Inconsistencies: How and When Browsers Download Images](/2018/06/image-inconsistencies-how-and-when-browsers-download-images/)
* [BEMIT: Taking the BEM Naming Convention a Step Further](/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/)

I’m next speaking at:
