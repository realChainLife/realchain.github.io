I shall be giving my first workshop in association with the great guys at
[Make Do](http://makedo.in/) in my hometown, Leeds, on 29 November, 2013. The
workshop, <a href="http://makedo.in/leeds/css-workshop/"><cite>Planning and
building a big front-end</cite></a>, is a full-day event held in the centre of
the city, where attendees will learn about optimal CSS architecture, naming
conventions, scalability, pragmatism, tying things all together with Sass, and a
lot, _lot_ more.

This event is incredibly good value, at only &pound;225 per ticket (&pound;200
for early bird), and the Make Do guys are sure to plan a great after-party as
well! <a href="http://makedo.in/leeds/css-workshop/">See you there?</a>
