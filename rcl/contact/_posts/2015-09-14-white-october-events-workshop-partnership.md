I’m really excited to announce a new partnering with London-based events company
[White October Events](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/). The aim is to be
able to offer semi-frequent _public_ workshops.

Whereas the majority of my workshops are for private clients—who need tailored
advice and training around their particular product—there is undoubtedly a huge
market for individuals from companies to be able to learn similar techniques in
a more generalised and high-level manner.

I’m really looking forward to being able to offer these kinds of workshop
through White October Events—a company with a great reputation and demonstrable
experience running tech events.

The first two events are scheduled for [25 September,
2015](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/css-workshop-september/) and [20
November, 2015](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/css-workshop-november/)
both in London, UK. Topics will include

* how to assess, normalise, and **rationalise designs**;
* how to split designs up into discrete **objects, abstractions and components**;
* naming conventions and general **advice for naming things**;
* the **ITCSS architecture** for managing CSS projects;
* how to effectively **manage layout**;
* **theming** and skinning;
* how to use **Sass** to tie things together;
* and anything **more** you think of on the day!
