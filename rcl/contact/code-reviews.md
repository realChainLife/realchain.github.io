For clients who don’t yet need a full consultancy engagement, or an entire
workshop, or maybe just need to learn what they need to fix next, there is an
affordable, off-the-shelf solution that is perfect for you: a **two-day remote
audit**.

<ul class="c-nav-secondary">
  <li class="c-nav-secondary__item"><a href="#section:performance-audits" class="c-nav-secondary__link">Performance Audits</a></li>
  <li class="c-nav-secondary__item"><a href="#section:code-reviews" class="c-nav-secondary__link">Code Reviews</a></li>
</ul>

Reviews and audits in three simple steps:

1. **I get access to your codebase** and spend two days reviewing/auditing it.
2. **I provide you with a review document** and supporting materials.
3. **We have a 90 minute Skype call** to discuss the document and next steps.

As well as the core review document, you’ll be provided with any generated
reports from any tools or automated tests, screencasts, refactored examples, and
anything else that supports the audit.

The practical upshot of which is an improved codebase for the particular
product, site, or app in question, but also—and more importantly—a formal
document based around your own code which would prevent you making the same
mistakes in future. A tailored lesson, centred around your own work. For a more
detailed overview of the service, please read [the associated blog
post](/2013/11/code-reviews-as-service/). If you have _any_ questions about code
reviews then please feel free to [email me](mailto:csswizardry@gmail.com).

**N.B.:** Audits and reviews are tailored to your specific project or problem: I
will survey you before we start and find out if there are particular areas you’d
like me to focus on more than others. It might be an off-the-shelf solution, but
it still needs to provide individual value.

Code review clients include: the BBC, Hired, UEFA.

## Performance Audits

If your site seems slow, or you know your performance could be improved, you
probably want to find out how and why. During the performance audit I’ll:

* identify any quick wins;
* uncover any performance bottlenecks;
* highlight good work that needs maintaining;
* create and explain reports and insights;
* improve network and runtime performance;
* describe how new approaches and technologies can help;
* provide action points for designers, developers, engineers, and Ops teams;
* recommend tooling and monitoring;
* a whole bunch more.

This will leave you well poised to begin implementing performance improvements
across the entire stack, and faster sites mean more conversions, better
retention, reduced costs, and happier users.

This service is perfect for projects whose budget typically would not stretch to
getting me on-site for a number of days, but do require the same type and
quality of input.

A remote code review allows me to assess and audit the CSS that powers your
project. In it, I will:

* spot any anti-patterns or code smells;
* identify bottlenecks that may prevent scalability;
* provide refactored examples;
* uncover any performance issues;
* assess architectural oversights or concerns;
* make recommendations around naming conventions;
* review anything else you feel needs particular focus.

This will leave your team in a good place to begin tackling any tech debt, as
well as opening up the codebase to be further extended and developed upon.
