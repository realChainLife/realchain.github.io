* For consulting engagements, please [send me an
  email](mailto:csswizardry@gmail.com).
* For speaking engagements, please [see my speaking
  page](/speaking/#section:request).
* For general questions and advice, please see [my AMA
  repository](https://github.com/csswizardry/ama).
* For small questions, or just to say hi, please feel free to [fire me a
  Tweet](https://twitter.com/csswizardry).
* For questions about software and tools, see [my setup](/uses/).
* To keep in regular contact, [join my newsletter](/newsletter/).

Please note that I get a _lot_ of email, so it may take me a while to get back
to you. I do try and reply to everyone, no matter how long it might take, but I
do also try and prioritise the order in which I respond: client and work-related
emails first, then speaking requests, and then general requests for help and
advice.

If I do seem to be taking a while to respond, I would not be at all offended if
you tweeted at me, or sent me a follow-up email, to remind me to reply.
